As in every other part of the world settled by Europeans, the House-Mouse appears to be abundant throughout Central America. Mr. Tomes observed of two specimens sent by Mr. Salvin from Guatemala that they were smaller than European examples, and that he had noticed the same difference in others sent by Fraser from Colombia2.
Dr. v. Frantzius remarks that in Costa Rica Mice may be seen running about the floors of the best houses in broad daylight, and that, as they do little damage compared with Rats, no trouble is taken to extirpate them3.
2. HESPEROMYS.
Hesperomys, Waterhouse, Zool. Voy. ‘Beagle,’ i. p. 75 (1839).
The greater number of the Muridæ of the New World are referable to Mr. Waterhouse’s genus Hesperomys, as restricted by Professor Spencer F. Baird* and Dr. Elliott Coues†. The members of this extensive genus all agree in having a typically murine skull, and in their dentition—the incisors not being grooved, the first having three roots, and the second and third diminishing in size successively. They differ, however, among themselves in many other important characters, and form a number of separate groups, some of which might well be regarded as of generic value, were it not for the inter-grading forms which connect one with another and prevent their being sharply defined. Nevertheless they may be conveniently retained as subgenera, the recognition and definition of the numerous species being thereby rendered more easy. Of these subgenera Dr. Coues recognized six North-American forms, to which I think at least two more (Nyctomys and Tylomys) must be added, making eight in all. Of these, four are represented in Central America by about twelve species. These may be thus characterized:—
A. VESPEROMYS, Coues, Proc. Ac. Philad. 1874, p. 178. Form mouse-like; ears large, scantily haired; tail moderate or long, closely haired; small internal cheek-pouches usually (or always?) present. Skull with no marked supra-orbital process.
