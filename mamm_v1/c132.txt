while others from Brazil are under 10 inches, although evidently adult. Nor is it constantly connected with any of the numerous varieties of coloration—rufous, grizzled, and melanistic specimens occurring of all sizes. In this case, also, Mr. Allen has fully accepted my determination3.
S. variabilis appears merely to enter the most southern portion of our subregion; the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge, Massachusetts, has received specimens from Panama collected by Dr. Maack and by the Hassler Expedition6; and there are others, obtained in the same State by M. Boucard, in the Paris Museum. I have been unable to trace it further north.

There are two marked geographical races of this well-known Neotropical species, and some confusion has arisen as to their relationship and nomenclature. The northern form, ranging from Nicaragua to Ecuador, is distinguished by its large size and its bright red belly and tail, and was first described as a variety by Professor Peters2. It subsequently became the ground of several of Gray’s nominal species, and was then identified by Mr. Allen with the Sciurus rufo-niger of Pucheran4. In my review of the Neotropical Squirrels I was enabled to show that this was an error; and although expressing my belief that the races would yet be found to intergrade, I felt compelled in the absence of intermediate specimens to separate the northern variety provisionally under Gray’s name of S. griseogenys8. Mr. Allen followed the example, but preferred to raise Dr. Peters’s varietal title of hoffmanni to specific value5. Since then, however, my friend Mr. Oldfield Thomas has described complete connecting links, which he finds in specimens from Ecuador, exactly the locality from which they might be expected, as it is there that the Andean and Amazonian races meet*. Mr. Allen and I are there-
