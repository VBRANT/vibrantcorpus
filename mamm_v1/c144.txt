144 GLIRES.
Dr. v. Frantzius has stated that Professor Peters has recorded the occurrence in Guatemala of Hesperomys albigularis, Tomes (giving a reference to the ‘Monatsbericht,’ 1860, p. 105*); but Dr. Peters assures me that this is a complete mistake, and that he never received that species from Central America.
1. Hesperomys teguina. (Tab. XIV. fig. 1.)
Mus teguina, Gray, P. Z. S. 1843, p. 79 (sine descr.)1.
Hesperomys teguina, Alston, P. Z. S. 1876, p. 755 (descr. orig.)2; Alston, op. cit. 1877, p. 446.
Hab. GUATEMALA, Coban (Mus. Brit.1).
This very peculiar-looking species was named without description by Gray in 18431, and first characterized by me in 18762. As yet it is only known from the mounted type in the British Museum, purchased along with a number of other Guatemalan animals from Leadbeater; and I only provisionally refer it to the subgenus Vesperomys until its whole organization is known. In the comparative shortness of its tail and in its nearly uniform rich coloration it is strikingly different from all the Nearctic Mice, and also from all the Neotropical forms with which I am acquainted.
2. Hesperomys leucopus.
Mus leucopus, Rafinesque, Am. Monthly Mag. iii. p. 446 (1818, descr. orig., fide Baird)1.
Hesperomys texanus, Woodhouse, Proc. Ac. Philad. vi. p. 242 (1853, descr. orig.)2; Baird, Mamm. N. Am. p. 4643; Baird, Rep. U.S. Mex. Bound. Surv. ii. Mamm. p. 434.
Hesperomys sonoriensis, Le Conte, Proc. Ac. Philad. vi. p. 413 (1853, descr. orig.)5; Baird, Mamm. N. Am. p. 4746; Baird, Rep. U.S. Mex. Bound. Surv. ii. Mamm. p. 437.
Hesperomys (Vesperomys) leucopus sonoriensis, Coues, Proc. Ac. Philad. 1874, p. 1798.
Hesperomys leucopus sonoriensis, Coues, Mon. N.-Am. Rodent. p. 799.
Hesperomys americanus, Coues, Amer. Nat. xiii. p. 231 (1879, ex Kerr†)10.
Hab. NORTH AMERICA, from the Arctic Regions southwards9.—MEXICO (Deppe, Mus. Berol.), Charco Escondido (Couch, U.S. Nat. Mus.4), Sonora (Clark, ib.4), Oaxaca (Sallé, Mus. Brit.).
The variety or geographical race of the Common White-footed Mouse, which inhabits the interior of North America west of the Mississippi, was first described as a distinct species by Le Conte5 from a North-Mexican specimen. The “variety” is
* Arch. f. Naturg. xxxv. 1, p. 271.
† Founded on Kerr’s Mus agrarius americanus (An. Kingd. 1792, p. 231), which is described as a variety of the European M. agrarius. Not being used binomially, the term has no claims on adoption; but even if it had been otherwise, it cannot be received, as Kerr had already described a M. americanus (tom. cit. p. 227) based on Pennant’s “American Rat” of the Leverian Museum (Hist. Quad. p. 441; Arct. Zool. i. p. 130)—an animal which is probably undeterminable, unless it may have been founded on American examples of M. rattus.
