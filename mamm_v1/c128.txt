128 GLIRES.
hairs being finely ringed with bright rufous and tipped with white; nape and rump more strongly rufous. Lower parts bright red, orange, or white.
Many specimens, however, which have the general appearance of aureogaster show the rufous subterminal ring of leucops on some part of the dorsal surface; and in others we find the red nape and rump-patches gradually appearing. I am therefore compelled to return to the view long ago expressed by Isidore Geoffroy5, and to regard them as varieties of the same species.
With regard to distribution, most of the examples which I have seen with authenticated localities are from Mexico; but Mr. Allen mentions one from Guatemala in the Washington Museum, and there is one from the same country at Berlin. Specimens in the British Museum are labelled as being from Colombia; but there can be little doubt that this is an error. S. aureogaster is stated by Prof. Sumichrast (as quoted by Mr. Allen) to be “the common species of Sciurus of the tierra caliente of the east coast” of Mexico; and both forms are found in the States of Oaxaca and Tehuantepec.
In his latest revision of the American Squirrels, Mr. Allen has accepted the above identifications, and only differs from me as to the proper name of the species. This he still holds to be Frédéric Cuvier’s barbarous title of aureogaster (or, as Mr. Allen prefers to write it, aureigaster), rejecting Erxleben’s name of variegatus as being insufficiently defined and “admittedly composite” 8. In this I must venture still to differ from my much-esteemed fellow-worker. S. variegatus was founded primarily on the Coztiocotequallin * of Hernandez, Buffon’s Coquallin being merely quoted as a synonym; and Erxleben’s diagnosis and description appear to me to be quite characteristic of the leucops form of the present species†. That some subsequent compilers should have confused S. variegatus with S. niger seems to me to be no good reason for abandoning the name in favour of such a thoroughly objectionable title as S. aureogaster.
