The numerous nominal species whose names are given above were arranged in Mr. Allen’s Monograph as synonyms of two species, S. hypopyrrhus3 and S. boothiæ11. An examination of the series in the various European Museums, including most of the types, enabled me to show that they thoroughly intergrade5, a conclusion which has since been accepted by Mr. Allen4. I have even grave doubts as to whether they are really separable from the last species. But as I have not yet found specimens strictly intermediate between S. variegatus and S. hypopyrrhus in the character of the pelage and the annulation of the fur, it seems best to keep them distinct.
In this species the differences in comparative length of tail and ears, on which Mr. Allen laid most weight in separating S. boothiæ from S. hypopyrrhus, cannot be depended on; and I have been totally unable to detect any constant difference in general stoutness of form or breadth of muzzle. As to colour, the intergradations of the different varieties are quite complete; so that it is often difficult or impossible to say to which a given specimen is to be referred. Each variety, however, has its own type, and seems to predominate in its own immediate locality. The five principal phases known to me may be thus arranged:—
1. The hypopyrrhus type. Upper parts dark grey, the hairs black, ringed with white or pale fulvous. Lower parts either concolorous with the upper, or washed with rufous. To this variety I agree with Mr. Allen in referring Bennett’s S. nigrescens6; and it is to the same form that the description of Macroxus boothiæ in Gray’s memoir of 1867 refers, although that author’s Sciurus boothiæ of 184310 was founded on a young example of
