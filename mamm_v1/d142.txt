As in every other part of the world settled by Europeans, the House-Mouse appears 

to be abundant throughout Central America. Mr. Tomes observed of two specimens 

sent by Mr. Salvin from Guatemala that they were smaller than European examples, and 

that he had noticed the same difference in others sent by Eraser from Colombia^. 

Dr. V. Frantzius remarks that in CostaRica Mice may be seen running about the floors 

of the best houses in broad daylight, and that, as they do little damage compared with 

Bats, no trouble is taken to extirpate them^. 

2. HESPEKOMYS. 

Hesperomys, Waterhouse, Zool. Voy. 'Beagle,^ i. p. 75 (1839). 

The greater number of the Muridse of the New World are referable to Mr. Water- 

house's genus Hesperomys, as restricted by Professor Spencer F. Baird * and Dr. Elliott 
Couesf
. The members of this extensive genus all agree in having a typically murine 

skull, and in their dentition—the incisors notbeing grooved, the first having three roots, 
and the second and third diminishing in size successively. They differ, however, among 
themselves in many other important characters, and form a number of separate groups, 
some of which might well be regarded as of generic value, were it not for the inter- 
grading forms which connect one with another and prevent their being sharply defined. 
Nevertheless they may be conveniently retained as subgenera, the recognition and defi- 

nition of the numerous species being thereby rendered more easy. Of these subgenera 
Dr. Coues recognized six North-American forms, to which I think at least two more 
{Nyctomys and Tylomys) must be added, making eight in all. Of these, four are repre- 
sented in CentralAmerica by about twelve species. These may be thus characterized:

— 

A. Vesperomys, Coues, Proc. Ac. Philad. 1874, p. 178. Eorm mouse-like ; ears 

large, scantily haired ; tail moderate or long, closely haired ; small internal 
cheek-pouches usually (or always %) present. Skull with no marked supra- 
orbital process. 

1. H. teguina%. Above warm dark reddish-brown, passing into deep fawn below. 
Length of head and body 3"-25, of tail about 2".
