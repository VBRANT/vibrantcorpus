MUS. 141
1. Mus rattus.
Mus rattus, Linnæus, Syst. Nat. i. p. 83 (1766, descr. orig.)1; Frantzius, Arch. f. Naturg. xxxv. 1, p. 2702; Dugès, La Nat. i. p. 1383.
Hab. COSMOPOLITAN.—MEXICO (Deppe, Mus. Berol.), Guanajuato (Dugès3); COSTA RICA (Frantzius2).
The Black Rat has been recorded from Mexico, whence a specimen was sent by Deppe to the Berlin Museum, and where it was found by Dr. Dugès in the State of Guanajuato3, and from Costa Rica, where Dr. v. Frantzius says it is the only true Rat known. Not exposed to the competition of the next species, and finding suitable shelter in the numerous rents and fissures which earthquakes cause in the clay walls of the houses, the Black Rat has become extremely plentiful in most parts of the latter country, although it is said to have been first introduced by Spanish ships so recently as the beginning of the present century2.
2. Mus alexandrinus.
Mus alexandrinus, Ét. Geoffroy, Descr. de PÉgypt, Hist. Nat. ii. p. 733, Atlas, pl. v. fig. 1 (1812, descr. orig.)1.
Mus tectorum, Savi, Nuov. Giorn. de’ Lett., Pte Scient. x. p. 73 (1825, descr. orig.)2; Baird, Mamm. N. Am. p. 4413; Baird, Rep. U.S. Mex. Bound. Surv. ii. Mamm. p. 424.
Hab. COSMOPOLITAN.—MEXICO, Matamoras (Berlandier, U.S. Nat. Mus.4), Nuevo Leon (Couch, ib.4), Oaxaca (Sallé, Mus. Brit.).
This species is very closely allied to the last, with which it is said to interbreed and to produce fertile young*. It appears to remain constant in coloration in all climates; and as it especially affects ships, it has become very widely spread over the world. It is probably not common, however, in Central America; for the only specimens that I know of are the Mexican ones recorded above.
3. Mus decumanus.
Mus decumanus, Pallas, Nov. Sp. Glir. p. 91 (1778, descr. orig.)1; Dugès, La Nat. i. p. 1382.
Hab. COSMOPOLITAN.—MEXICO, Guanajuato, Guadalajara (Dugès2).
In Costa Rica, as already noticed, the Brown Rat is still unknown; and this is the more remarkable, as Dr. v. Frantzius remarks, because it commonly infests the English and German ships which visit the port of Puntarenas.
In Mexico Dr. Dugès observed it in the States of Guanajuato and Guadalajara2; but I have never myself seen a specimen from any part of Central America.
