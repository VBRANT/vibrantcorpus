The numerous nominal species whose names are given above vrere arranged in Mr. 

Allen's Monograph as synonyms of two species, S. hypopyrrhus ^ and S. hoothice ^i. An 
examination ofthe series in the various EuropeanMuseums, including most of the types, 
enabled me to show that they thoroughly intergrade^, a conclusion which has since 
been accepted by Mr. Allen ^. I have even grave doubts as to whether they are really 

separable from the last species. But as I have not yet found specimens strictly inter- 
mediate between S. variegatus and S. hypopyrrhus in the character of the pelage and 

the annulation of the fur, it seems best to keep them distinct. 
In this species the differences in comparative length of tail and ears, on which Mr. 

Allen laid most weight in separating S. hoothice from S. hypopyrrhus, cannot be depended 
on ; and Ihave been totally unable to detect any constant difference in general stoutness 

of form or breadth of muzzle. As to colour, the intergradations of the different varieties 

are quite complete ; so that it is often difficult or impossible to say to which a given 

specimen is to be referred. Each variety, however, has its own type, and seems to 
predominate in its own immediate locality. The five principal phases known to me 
may be thus arranged :

— 

1. The hypopyrrhus type. Upper parts dark grey, the hairs black, ringed with 
white or pale fulvous. Lower parts either concolorous with the upper, or 
washed with rufous. To this variety I agree with Mr. Allen in referring 

Bennett's S. nigrescens^; and it is to the same form that the description 

of Macroxus hoothice in Gray's memoir of 1867 refers, although that 

author's Sciurus hoothice of 1843 ^^ was founded on a young example of 

BIOL. CENT.-AMEE., Mamm. Vol. 1, June 1880. S
