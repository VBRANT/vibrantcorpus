TAPIEIJS. 101 

Above it is rather thickly covered with brownish-black hairs of about three quarters of 
an inch in length. The face is rather paler. The ears, except for a portion of their 
outer rims, are distinctly margined with clear white. The throat and chest are of a 
sordid white " *. This individual died about six weeks after the date of Mr. Sclater's 
description, and is preserved in the British Museum ; its skin shows no traces of spots, 
but the dirty white throat and chest are conspicuous ; the chin is dusky, and the edges 
of the lips and the snout round the muzzle are pure white. The only other entire 
specimen of Dow's Tapir which is known to me is the one in the Paris Museum, from 
which Plate IX. is drawn. This animal, although not yet fully adultf
, is still evidently 
full-grown, and its coloration is presumably the permanent livery. According to a 

carefully executed coloured drawing which Professor Alphonse Milne-Edwards has 
been so good as to send me, the white markings have wholly disappeared, and the 
animal is of a nearly uniform blackish brown, lighter on the head, and passing into 
pale brown on the cheeks, the edges of the lips, and the tips of the ears. 
To sum up the scanty information we possess as to the external characters of the 
two forms. The young of T. hairdi is reddish brown, with irregular white spots and 

stripes ; that of T. dowi is said to be unspotted. A half-grown specimen of the former 

is dark reddish brown, with chestnut cheeks and a pure white chest ; a similar indi- 

vidual of the latter is blackish brown, with a dirty white chest. The adult of T. hairdi 

is still undescribed ; that of T. dowi is blackish brown, the head being paler.
