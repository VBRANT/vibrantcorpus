Two or three of the other North-American Squirrels approach our regional boundary, 

if they do not actually cross it. Mr. Allen says that the western ludovicianus race of 

the Fox-Squirrel, S. niger, Linnaeus, " doubtless ranges far into Mexico "*; buthe adduces 
no evidence in support of his belief. S. fossor, Peale, and S. aherti, Woodhouse, are 

species of limited range, inhabiting California and Arizona ; but as yet there is no 

record of their having been obtained in Mexico.
