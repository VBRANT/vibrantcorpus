This appears to be a species of very limited range, and it is extremely rare in collec- 

tions. Originally described from a Californian specimen i, it has been obtained at only 

a few places in New Mexico, Texas, Chihuahua, and Sonora ; and the United-States 

National Museum, so rich in large series of native animals, could only boast of six 

specimens when Mr. Allen published his monograph. Dr. Kennerly, however, says 

that in Sonora " this species was quite common on the prairies around Janos. It lived 

sometimes among the rocks, but more often had its bed in piles of dirt heaped around 

the base of some bush. These piles were elevated." several feet above the surrounding 

ground, and were entered by three, four, or more apertures near the summit. The 

animals were exceedingly shy, and a specimen was procured with difficulty " ^.

Erxleben's Sciurusmexicanus,heing primarily founded on theTlalmototli ofHernandez, 

must have been partially intended to represent this species ; but the description has 

evidently been confused with that of some other animal, probably of a Tamias. No 

recognizable description can be found prior to that of Lichtenstein, which was founded 

on a specimen obtained by Deppe in Central Mexico. The species appears to be very 

characteristic of the tableland of that country, ranging from Texas to the southern 

and western States of the Mexican Republic. 
Of the habits of the Mexican Spermophile the following brief account is given by 

Mr.Clark, of the United-States Boundary Survey :—" This species was found in greatest 

numbers in the valley of the lower Eio Grande. It lives in the ground ; and its burrow 

is always made with reference to the protection afforded by a thorny bush or cactus
