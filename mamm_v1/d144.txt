Dr. V. Frantzius has stated that Professor Peters has recorded the occurrence in 

Guatemala of Hesperomys albigularis. Tomes (giving a reference to the ' Monatsbericht,' 

1860, p. 105*); but Dr. Peters assures me that this is a complete mistake, and that he 

never received that species from Central America. 

1. Hesperomys tegnina. (Tab. XIV. fig. l.)

Hah. Guatemala, Coban {Mus. Brit.^). 

This very peculiar-looking species was named vrithout description by Gray in 1843 1, 
and first characterized by me in 1876 2. As yet it is only known from the mounted 

type in the British Museum, purchased along with a number of other Guatemalan 

animals from Leadbeater ; and I only provisionally refer it to the subgenus Ves^eroinys 

until its whole organization is known. In the comparative shortness of its tail and 

in its nearly uniform rich coloration it is strikingly difierent from all the Nearctic 

Mice, and also from all the Neotropical forms with which I am acquainted.

The variety or geographical race of the Common White-footed Mouse, which 

inhabits the interior of North America west of the Mississippi, was first described as 
a distinct species by Le Conte^ from a North-Mexican specimen. The "variety" is 

* Arch. f. Naturg. xxxv. 1, p. 271. 

t Founded on Kerr's Mus agrarius americanus (An, Kingd. 1792, p. 231), -which is described as a variety 

of the European M. agrarius. Not being used binomially, the term has no claims on adoption ; but even 

if it had been otherwise, it cannot be received, as Kerr had already described a M. americanus (tom. eit. 

p. 227) based on Pennant's "American Eat" of the Leverian Museum (Hist. Quad. p. 441; Arct. Zool. i. 

p. 130)—an animal which is probably undeterminable, unless it may have been founded on American examples 

ofM. rattus.
