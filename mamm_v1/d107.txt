DICOTYLES. 107 

1. D. tajacu. Colour dark grey, with a white or whitish band passing across the 

chest from shoulder to shoulder. Length of head and body about 36". 

2. D. laUatus. Colour blackish, with the lips and lower jaw pure white. Length 

of head and body about 40". 

Cranial characters have also been pointed out by Dr. Krauss, based on the comparison 

of a considerable number of skulls*. In captivity they have been known to interbreed 

; 

a hybrid between a male D. lahiatus and female B. tajacu was born in the Zoological 

Society's Gardens in 1864f.

The Collared Peccary has a very extensive range in theNewWorld, going as far north 

as 36° North latitude on the Eed Eiver ofArkansas, and as far south as 40° South lati- 

tude on the Eio Negro of Patagonia. In its habits, which have been well described by 

Azara and by subsequent writers, it differs considerably from its congener, B. laUatus. 

It does not go in great droves, but is found singly or in pairs, or at most in small parties 

of from eight to ten ; and it is a comparatively harmless animal, not being inclined to 

attack other animals or human beings.

X Audubon and Bachman very strangely state that " it is impossible to ascertain " to which species of Pec- 

cary Linnseus applied the name of Sus tajacu (Quad. F. Am. i. p. 240). They cannot have read his descrip- 

tion, which leaves not the slightest room for doubt ; and yet almost every subsequent author has followed 

them in using Cuviers name instead of the Linnsean one, which appears to have been first restored by 

Mr. Sclater^ P2
