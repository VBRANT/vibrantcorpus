This appears to be a species of very limited range, and it is extremely rare in collections. Originally described from a Californian specimen1, it has been obtained at only a few places in New Mexico, Texas, Chihuahua, and Sonora; and the United-States National Museum, so rich in large series of native animals, could only boast of six specimens when Mr. Allen published his monograph. Dr. Kennerly, however, says that in Sonora “this species was quite common on the prairies around Janos. It lived sometimes among the rocks, but more often had its bed in piles of dirt heaped around the base of some bush. These piles were elevated several feet above the surrounding ground, and were entered by three, four, or more apertures near the summit. The animals were exceedingly shy, and a specimen was procured with difficulty”3.

Hab. NORTH AMERICA, Texas6.—MEXICO (Verreaux, Mus. Brit.), Toluca (Deppe, Mus. Berol.2), Pesqueria Grande, Matamoras (Couch, Berlandier, U.S. Nat. Mus.4), Guadalajara, Guanajuato (Dugès5), Tlalpam (Geddes, Mus. Brit.).
Erxleben’s Sciurus mexicanus, being primarily founded on the Tlalmototli of Hernandez, must have been partially intended to represent this species; but the description has evidently been confused with that of some other animal, probably of a Tamias. No recognizable description can be found prior to that of Lichtenstein, which was founded on a specimen obtained by Deppe in Central Mexico. The species appears to be very characteristic of the tableland of that country, ranging from Texas to the southern and western States of the Mexican Republic.
Of the habits of the Mexican Spermophile the following brief account is given by Mr. Clark, of the United-States Boundary Survey:—"This species was found in greatest numbers in the valley of the lower Rio Grande. It lives in the ground; and its burrow is always made with reference to the protection afforded by a thorny bush or cactus
