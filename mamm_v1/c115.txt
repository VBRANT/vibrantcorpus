CARIACUS. 115
to have been unknown to Drs. Berlandier and Dugès, and to M. de Saussure, it is not probable that it ranges far into Mexico.

As already observed, I feel myself compelled to follow the example of the more recent American writers in rejecting the claims of the Mexican Deer to constitute a distinct species from Cariacus virginianus. Its only distinctive characters lie in its smaller size and comparatively simple antlers, and in its not presenting the seasonal change of colour observable in the northern animal; but in all these points there appears to be a regular intergradation, the Deer of Texas and the Gulf States being strictly intermediate. Sir Victor Brooke, although keeping the forms provisionally distinct, expresses the opinion that not only C. mexicanus, but also the South-American C. similis, C. savannarum,  and C. peruvianus will probably prove to be “nothing more than climatic varieties of C. virginianus, connected inseparably by every shade of intermediate forms,” and that they thus present another illustration of Mr. Allen’s law of the decrease in size of Nearctic types in their range to the southward†. Of C. mexicanus he remarks that “there are not more than six points, inclusive of the brow-antler, on both antlers
* Sir Victor Brooke remarks that “the description and dimensions given by Pennant [Hist. Quad. i. p. 110 are reconcilable with the Cervus mexicanus of Lichtenstein; but the antlers figured by him (pl. xi.fig. 3) are certainly not referable to the same form. They appear rather to represent abnormal antlers of Cariacus macrotis“ (P. Z. S. 1878, p. 919). It seems to me more probable that these antlers belonged to C. leucurus (Dougl.), which recent American zoologists consider to be a local race of C. virginianus; they much resemble the remarkable Nebraska head figured by Baird (Mamm. N. Am. p. 652,fig. 18).
