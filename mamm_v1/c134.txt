On examining the type of Pucheran’s Sciurus rufoniger in the Paris Museum, I found that it was not a variety of S. æstuans, as Mr. Allen had supposed in his Monograph, but rather allied to S. deppei; and I soon recognized in it a small Squirrel of which I had seen several specimens from Panama, and which I had begun to fear would require a new name. These examples prove to agree further with S. deppei in having two upper premolars, but differ in being more than one third smaller, in the colour of the lower parts (which are only paler than the upper, save on the breast), and in the tail being nearly uniform in colour with the back (the hairs having only very minute white or yellow tips)2. On receiving a specimen of this Squirrel from me, Mr. Allen at once recognized its claim to specific distinction 3; but he has since called my attention to the fact that the name of rufoniger was preoccupied, having been applied to an Asiatic Squirrel by Gray three years before the date of Pucheran’s description*. But the specimen to which Pucheran gave the name of S. chrysuros is clearly identical with his S. rufoniger, differing only in having a somewhat more rufous tail2, and this title can therefore be used for the species.
[TAMIAS.]
Several species of Chipmunks or Ground-Squirrels are widely distributed throughout North America. According to Mr. Allen, both the dorsalis variety of Tamias asiaticus (Gmelin) and T. harrisi (Audubon and Bachman) are found in New Mexico; and he believes that the range of the latter species “probably extends in the interior far southwards into Western Mexico” †. There appears, however, to be no direct evidence that this is the case.
