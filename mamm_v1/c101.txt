TAPIRUS. 101
Above it is rather thickly covered with brownish-black hairs of about three quarters of an inch in length. The face is rather paler. The ears, except for a portion of their outer rims, are distinctly margined with clear white. The throat and chest are of a sordid white”*. This individual died about six weeks after the date of Mr. Sclater’s description, and is preserved in the British Museum; its skin shows no traces of spots, but the dirty white throat and chest are conspicuous; the chin is dusky, and the edges of the lips and the snout round the muzzle are pure white. The only other entire specimen of Dow’s Tapir which is known to me is the one in the Paris Museum, from which Plate IX. is drawn. This animal, although not yet fully adult†, is still evidently full-grown, and its coloration is presumably the permanent livery. According to a carefully executed coloured drawing which Professor Alphonse Milne-Edwards has been so good as to send me, the white markings have wholly disappeared, and the animal is of a nearly uniform blackish brown, lighter on the head, and passing into pale brown on the cheeks, the edges of the lips, and the tips of the ears.
To sum up the scanty information we possess as to the external characters of the two forms. The young of T. bairdi is reddish brown, with irregular white spots and stripes; that of T. dowi is said to be unspotted. A half-grown specimen of the former is dark reddish brown, with chestnut cheeks and a pure white chest; a similar individual of the latter is blackish brown, with a dirty white chest. The adult of T. bairdi is still undescribed; that of T. dowi is blackish brown, the head being paler.
