DICOTYLES. 107
1. D. tajacu. Colour dark grey, with a white or whitish band passing across the chest from shoulder to shoulder. Length of head and body about 36".
2. D. labiatus. Colour blackish, with the lips and lower jaw pure white. Length of head and body about 40".
Cranial characters have also been pointed out by Dr. Krauss, based on the comparison of a considerable number of skulls*. In captivity they have been known to interbreed; a hybrid between a male D. labiatus and female D. tajacu was born in the Zoological Society’s Gardens in 1864†.

The Collared Peccary has a very extensive range in the New World, going as far north as 36° North latitude on the Red River of Arkansas, and as far south as 40° South latitude on the Rio Negro of Patagonia. In its habits, which have been well described by Azara and by subsequent writers, it differs considerably from its congener, D. labiatus. It does not go in great droves, but is found singly or in pairs, or at most in small parties of from eight to ten; and it is a comparatively harmless animal, not being inclined to attack other animals or human beings.

‡ Audubon and Bachman very strangely state that “it is impossible to ascertain” to which species of Peccary Linnæus applied the name of Sus tajacu (Quad. N. Am. i. p. 240). They cannot have read his description, which leaves not the slightest room for doubt; and yet almost every subsequent author has followed them in using Cuvier’s name instead of the Linnæan one, which appears to have been first restored by Mr. Sclater2.
