fore now at one in regarding the northern form as the hoffmanni variety of S. æstuans; but unfortunately there has not been time to correct the lettering of our Plate, which represents the types of Gray’s Macroxus griseogena and M. xanthotus.
In Costa Rica, according to Dr. v. Frantzius, this species is found along with S. rigidus [=S. hypopyrrhus] both in the warm lands of the coast and on the highest mountains. “In the cacao plantations, as in the Matina valley, they are so numerous, and destroy the ripe cacao-fruit (Mazorcas) in such quantities, that the principal duty of the overseer is to walk daily through the plantation and to shoot the Squirrels. Nevertheless a great number of cacao-beans are bitten and rendered unfit for sale; these are called ‘Cacao ardillado’ (from ardilla, a Squirrel), and are given in payment to the workmen.”

Mr. Allen was led to admit the validity of Gray’s M. tephrogaster, on finding that it differed from the last two species in having normally two well-developed upper premolars 5; and the specimens which I have been able to examine confirm his observation. He failed, however, to recognize this Squirrel in Professor Peters’s description of his S. deppei, which he doubtfully referred to the southern form of S. carolinensis. An examination of the types of S. deppei, M. tephrogaster, M. tæniurus, and M. medellinensis  convinced me that they are all strictly synonymous, the species presenting but little variation in coloration. In S. deppei and M. tæniurus the lower parts are washed with fulvous; in M. tephrogaster they are greyish white; while the types of M. medellinensis are smaller and have the middle of the back nearly black, exactly as in many specimens of S. æstuans. Intermediate examples occur; and the whole range of variation between the extremes is comparatively trifling 2.
In Guatemala, so far as Mr. Salvin knows, this species is confined in its range to the forests of the Pacific side of the Cordillera. Here it is not uncommon up to an elevation of about 3000 feet.
