9. S. chrysurus. Average length about 5"·50, of tail 3"·75. Two upper premolars. Upper parts dark olive, the hairs very minutely tipped with fulvous.

Two or three of the other North-American Squirrels approach our regional boundary, if they do not actually cross it. Mr. Allen says that the western ludovicianus race of the Fox-Squirrel, S. niger, Linnæus, “doubtless ranges far into Mexico"*; but he adduces no evidence in support of his belief. S. fossor, Peale, and S. aberti, Woodhouse, are species of limited range, inhabiting California and Arizona; but as yet there is no record of their having been obtained in Mexico.
