As already observed, I feel myself compelled to follow the example of the more recent 
American writers in rejecting the claims of the Mexican Deer to constitute a distinct 

species from Cariacus virginianus. Its only distinctive characters lie in its smaller size 
and comparatively simple antlers, and in its not presenting the seasonal change of colour 

observable in the northern animal; but in all these points there appears to be a regular 

intergradation, the Deer of Texas and the Gulf States being strictly intermediate. 

Sir Victor Brooke, although keeping the forms provisionally distinct, expresses the 

opinion that not only C. mexicanus, but also the South-American C. similis, C. savan- 
narum, and C. pertcvianus will probably prove to be "nothing more than climatic 

varieties of C. virginianus, connected inseparably by every shade of intermediate forms," 
and that they thus present another illustration of Mr. Allen's law of the decrease in 

size of Nearctic types in their range to the southwardf. Of C. mexicanus he remarks 

that " there are not more than six points, inclusive of the brow-antler, on both antlers 

* Sir Yictor Brooke remarks that " the description and dimensions given by Pennant [Hist. Quad. i. p. 110 

are reconcilable with the Cervus mexicanus of Lichtenstein ; but the antlers figured by him (pi. xi. fig. 3) are 

certainly not referable to the same form. They appear rather to represent abnormal antlers of Cariacus 

macrotis " (P. Z. S. 1878, p. 919). It seems to me more probable that these antlers belonged to C. leucurus 

(Dough), which recent American zoologists consider to be a local race of C. virginianus ; they much resemble 

the remarkable Nebraska head figured by Baird (Mamm. K. Am. p. 652, fig. 18).
