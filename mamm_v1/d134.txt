On examining the type of Pucheran's Sciurus rufoniger in the Paris Museum, I 

found that it was not a variety of S. cestuans, as Mr. Allen had supposed in his Mono- 

graph, but rather allied to S. deppei ; and 1 soon recognized in it a small Squirrel of 
which I had seen several specimens from Panama, and which I had begun to fear would 

require a new name. These examples prove to agree further with S. deppei in having 
two upper premolars, but diifer in being more than one third smaller, in the colour of 

the lower parts (which are only paler than the upper, save on the breast), and in the 

tail being nearly uniform in colour with the back (the hairs having only very minute 
white or yellow tips) ^. On receiving a specimen of this Squirrel from me, Mr. Allen 

at once recognized its claim to specific distinction ^ ; but he has since called my atten- 

tion to the fact that the name of rufoniger was preoccupied, having been applied to an 

Asiatic Squirrel by Gray three years before the date of Pucheran's description *. But 
the specimen to which Pucheran gave the name of S. chrysuros is clearly identical with 

his S. rufoniger, differing only in having a somewhat more rufous tail 2, and this title 
can therefore be used for the species. 

[TAMIAS.] 

Several species of Chipmunks or Ground-Squirrels are widely distributed throughout 
North America. According to Mr. Allen, both the dorsalis variety of Tamias asiaticus 
(Gmelin) and T. harrisi (Audubon and Bachman) are found in New Mexico ; and he 

believes that the range of the latter species " probably extends in the interior far 
southwards intoWestern Mexico " f. There appears, however, to be no direct evidence 

that this is the case. 

3. SPERMOPHILUS.
