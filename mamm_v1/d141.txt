1. Mus rattus. 
Mus rattus, Lmnseus, Syst. Nat. i. p. 83 (1766, descr. orig.) » ; Frantzius, Arch. f. Naturg. xxxv. 1, 

p. 2702; Dug^g^ La Nat. i. p. 138'. 

Eab. Cosmopolitan.—Mexico {Dep^e, Mus. Berol), Guanajuato (Duges^) ; Costa Kica 
{Frantzius^). 

The Black Rat has been recorded from Mexico, whence a specimen was sentby Deppe 

to the Berlin Museum, and where it was foundby Dr. Duges in the State of Guanajuato^, 
and from Costa Rica, where Dr. v. Frantzius says it is the only true Rat known. Not 
exposed to the competition of the next species, and finding suitable shelter in the 
numerous rents and fissureswhich earthquakes cause in the claywalls of the houses, the 
Black Rat has become extremely plentiful in most parts of the latter country, although 

it is said to have been first introduced by Spanish ships so recently as the beginning of 
the present century^. 

2. Mus alexandrinus. 
Mm alexandrinus, Et. Geoffroy, Descr. de FEgypt, Hist. Nat. ii. p. 733, Atlas, pi. v. fig. 1 (1812, 

descr. orig.)\ 
Mus tectorum, Savi, Nuov. Giorn. de' Lett., P*® Scient. x. p. 73 (1825, descr. orig.)2; Baird, Mamm. 
N. Am. p. 441' j Rep. U.S. Mex. Bound. Surv. ii. Mamm. p. 42*. 

Eab. Cosmopolitan.—Mexico, Matamoras {Berlandier, U.S. Nat. Mus.^), Nuevo Leon 

(Couch, ih.% Oaxaca [Salle, Mus. Brit.). 

This species is very closely allied to the last, with which it is said to interbreed and 

to produce fertile young*. It appears to remain constant in coloration in all climates ; 
and as it especially afiects ships, it has become very widely spread over the world. It 

is probably not common, however, in Central America ; for the only specimens that I 
know of are the Mexican ones recorded above. 

3. Mus decumanus. 

Mus decumanus, Pallas, Nov. Sp. Glir. p. 91 (1778, descr. orig.)^; Duges, La Nat. i. p. 138'^. 

Hah. Cosmopolitan.—Mexico, Guanajuato, Guadalajara (Buges^). 

In Costa Rica, as already noticed, the Brown Rat is still unknown; and this is the 
more remarkable, as Dr. v. Frantzius remarks, because it commonly infests the English 

and German ships which visit the port of Puntarenas. 

In Mexico Dr. Duges observed it in the States of Guanajuato and Guadalajara^; but 

I have never myself seen a specimen from any part of Central America.
