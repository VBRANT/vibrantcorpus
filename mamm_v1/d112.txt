Mexico, including certainly portions of the present States of Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, 

Cohahuila, Chihuahua, and Durango. It thus extended southward to at least the 25th 

parallel. It seems not, however, to have been abundant over much of this region, and 

to have been mainly extirpated prior to the beginning of the present century."

1. ANTILOCAPRA. 

Antilocapra, Ord, Journ. de Phys. Ixxxvii. p. 149 (1818). 
Dicranocerus (subgen.), Hamilton-Smith, GriflSth's An. King. v. p. 312 (1827). 
The second hollow-homed Ruminant which is now to be met with within our limits is 

theProng-buck or Prong-horn, a very aberrant form, which is highly characteristic of the 
western Nearctic fauna, but extends its range into the northern provinces of Mexico. 
Although the fact that the Prong-buck sheds it horns annually was long well known 

to hunters and backwoodsmen, and had been noted by one or two writers, yet it was 

generally disbelieved or ignored by zoologists ; and Mr. Bartlett, the observant Super- 

intendent of the Zoological Society's Gardens, was the first to demonstrate its truth 
and insist on its importance. Attention being thus directed to the subject, it was pro- 
posed almost simultaneously by Mr. Sclater and the late Dr. Gray that the Prong-horn 
should be regarded as the type of a distinct family, Antilocapridse ; and this view is 
confirmed by the observations of Dr. Murie, to whom we are indebted for a careful 

description of its anatomy *.

The last-named writer denies that the shedding of the horns is periodical or even frequent ; but on this point 
Judge Caton's observations seem to leave no room for doubt.
