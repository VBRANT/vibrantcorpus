7. Tachys lugubris.
Tachys lugubris, Motschulsky, Etud. Entom. 1855, p. 13; Motschulsky,Etud. Entom. 1862, p. 301.
Hab. PANAMA1.
According to the description, this species must be closely allied to T. castaneicolor.
8. Tachys tantillus.
Tachys tantilla, Motschulsky, Etud. Entom. 1862, p. 301.
Hab. PANAMA, Obispo1.
Probably near our T. curvans, but quite distinct, if the description is accurate, in the elytra having only one stria on each side of the suture.
9. Tachys æquinoctialis.
Tachys æquinoctialis, Motschulsky, Etud. Entom. 1855, p. 13.
Polyderis æquinoctialis, Motschlulsky, ibid. 1862, p. 331.
Hab. PANAMA1.
The description fits in many respects our T. chiriquinus; but the carina at the hind angles of the thorax, “angulis posticis obtusis subcarinatis,” is decisive of its not being that species. The carina near the hind angles is a character which occurs in the genera Xystosomus and Tachyta, but not in Tachys. Motschulsky does not say that the carina is “near;” if it were so, it would be in support of the generic separation of Polyderis from Tachys.
10. Tachys flavicollis.
Tachys flavicollis, Motschulsky, Etud. Entom. 1855, p. 13; Motschulsky,Etud. Entom. 1862, p.291.
Hab. PANAMA1, David (Champion).
Motschulsky’s description applies very well to a species taken, as above stated, by Mr. Champion. The species is rather vividly coloured, the head and elytra being chestnut-brown or black, shining without silky lustre, and the thorax yellowish red; the antennæ yellow, with joints 3–6 fuscous or blackish.
