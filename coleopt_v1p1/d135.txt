About twenty species of this much-misunderstood genus have been described. It is 

very widely distributed, being found in the tropical zones of America and Asia (inclu- 

* 
ding the Malay Archipelago and Japan), in Africa, Australia, and Madagascar. If the 

genus Trechicus, Leconte, is really synonymous, North America must be added to its 

range ; but, according to Dr. Horns recent observations, the mentum in Trechicus is

without tooth in its emargination, as stated by Dr. Leconte, the original describer; and 

it is therefore doubtful if the North-American species can be admitted into the genus, 

all the species of which hitherto examined having a prominent tooth to the mentum. 
M. Putzeys states that the male tarsi have four joints " sqammuleux" beneath. If 

this were really the case, the genus would be better placed in the group Quadripalmati 

than in the same group as the Anchomeninse ; but I doubt the accuracy of this obser- 

vation. In the larger species (e. g. P. Icevilateris) the squamse exist most certainly only 
on three of the joints.
