Eab. Mexico 1 2 3
, near the capital (Flohr). 

This species is confoundedwith the following (C. mcestus) in the Salle collection ; and 

a similar mistake was made by no less an authority than the late M. Putzeys, to whom 

I sent a set of Colpodw to name. There is no real difficulty, however, in distinguishing 

the two, C. lugens having a much broader head, and resembling a Platysma, whilst 

C. mcestus has the oval head and general form of Anchomenus § Agonum.

Eab. Guatemala \ Quezaltenango (Champion). 

I refer with some hesitation an example taken by Mr. Champion to this species, with 

the description of which it agrees except in colour, being deep black with a silky gloss, 

instead of " brun fonce presque noir."
