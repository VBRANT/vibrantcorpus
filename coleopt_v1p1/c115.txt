COLPODES. 115
60. Colpodes sexfoveolatus.
Colpodes sexfoveolatus, Chaudoir, Ann. Soc. Ent. Fr. 1878, p. 332.
Hab. MEXICO (Sallé).
61. Colpodes longipes.
Colpodes longipes, Chaudoir, Ann. Soc. Ent. Fr. 1878, p. 333.
Hab. MEXICO, Cuernavaca (Sallé).
62. Colpodes monachus.
Feronia monacha, Dej. Sp. Gén. Col. v. p. 7721.
Hab. MEXICO1, Guanajuato (Dugès, coll. Sallé).
This species was excluded from the genus Colpodes by Chaudoir. I find a label, in his handwriting, attached to a specimen in the Sallé collection inscribed “gen. nov., menti dente bifido;” but the bifid mentum-tooth is not of generic value in the group of which Colpodes forms part, Chaudoir himself, in his monograph of 1859, giving a great range of form of the tooth in his generic diagnosis. The shape of the fourth tarsal joint is probably the character which induced him to exclude the species, this joint being simply emarginated, even in the anterior legs; but the tarsi agree with the more typical species of the genus in being rather densely clothed with setæ beneath; and the long legs and general form of the insect agree better with Colpodes than with Anchomenus. The upper surface of the joints in the posterior tarsi is bisulcate, the sulci subdorsal and approximated.
63. Colpodes chloreus.
C. monacho proxime affinis, differt tantum colore supra cyanescenti-viridi.
Long. 5½–6½ lin.
Hab. MEXICO, Cuernavaca (Sallé, Boucard).
Of similar elongate, convex form to C. monachus, and differing very little, except in colour, from that species. The thorax, however, appears shorter, a little more narrowed towards the head, and more abruptly sinuated posteriorly, the widest part being near the middle and not anterior to it as in C. monachus.
64. Colpodes acuminatus.
Dyscolus acuminatus, Chevrolat, Col. Mex. ii. no. 185 (1835).
Stenocnemus Chevrolati, Chaudoir, Bull. Mosc. 1837, vii. p. 10.
Colpodes acuminatus, Chaudoir, Ann. Soc. Ent. Fr. 1859, p. 339; Chaudoir,Ann. Soc. Ent. Fr. 1878, p. 3351.
Var. Paulo robustior ef latior, spinis apicalibus brevioribus.
Hab. MEXICO, Cordova (Sallé, Höge), Jalapa (Höge).
Var. MEXICO, Guanajuato (Dugès, coll. Sallé).
