About twenty species of this much-misunderstood genus have been described. It is very widely distributed, being found in the tropical zones of America and Asia (including the Malay Archipelago and Japan), in Africa, Australia, and Madagascar. If the genus Trechicus, Leconte, is really synonymous, North America must be added to its range; but, according to Dr. Horn’s recent observations, the mentum in Trechicus is without tooth in its emargination, as stated by Dr. Leconte, the original describer; and it is therefore doubtful if the North-American species can be admitted into the genus, all the species of which hitherto examined having a prominent tooth to the mentum.
M. Putzeys states that the male tarsi have four joints “sqammuleux” beneath. If this were really the case, the genus would be better placed in the group Quadripalmati than in the same group as the Anchomeninæ; but I doubt the accuracy of this observation. In the larger species (e. g. P. lævilateris) the squamæ exist most certainly only on three of the joints.
