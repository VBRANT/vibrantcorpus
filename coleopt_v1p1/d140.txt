Probably near our T. curvans, but quite distinct, if the description is accurate, in the 

elytra having only one stria on each side of the suture.

that 

The description fits in many respects our T. chiriquinus ; but the carina at the hind 

gles of the thorax, " angulis posticis obtusis subcarinatis," is decisive of its not being 

species. The carina near the hind angles is a character which occurs in the genera

» 
Xystosomus and Tachyta, but not in Tachys. Motschulsky does not say that the cai 

is " near ;" if it were so, it would be in support of the generic separation of Polyd 

from Tachys.

Hab. Panama 1
, David (Champion). 

Motschulsky's description applies very well to a species taken, as above stated, by 

Mr. Champion. The species is rather vividly coloured, the head and elytra being 

chestnut-brown or black, Shining without silky lustre, and the thorax yellowish red 

; 

the antennae yellow, with joints 3-6 fuscous or blackish.
