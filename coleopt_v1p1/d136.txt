136 AJ)EPHAGA, 

Subdivision E. nati. 

Under this head I here combine the two groups Bipalmati and Subulipalpi of the 

" Geodephagous Coleoptera of Japan," thus reverting to the classification of Erichson 

in the 'Kafer der Mark Brandenburg.' The numerous connecting links between 

Trechus on the one hand and Tachys and Bembidium on the other show, in fact, the 

close relationship between them. The genus Ochthozetus, of the subfamily Pogoninae, 

connects, in another direction, the Bembidiinse, through the genus Bracteon (Bedel), 

with Pogonus and Patrobus. The subdivision is exceedingly numerous in species ; in 

all, the males have two joints only of the anterior tarsi furnished with ragged squamae 

beneath.

. 

A well-marked genus of small Carabidae of wide distribution. With the excep- 

tion of the lowlands in the equatorial zone, it seems to be cosmopolitan in its range, 

occurring in oceanic islands as well as on continents, and spreading into high latitudes 

both north and south. Nearly 200 species have been described, mostly from the cooler 

temperate zone and in mountain-ranges.

2. Trechus coarctatus. (Tab. VI. fig. 3.) 

T. mexicano affinis, sed major, thorace postice valde constricto elytrisque fere exstriatis. Elongatus, niger, 

politus, palpis, antennis etpedibus castaneo-rufis ; capite latiusculo, oculis sat prominentibus, vertice postice 
depresso ; thorace subelongato-cordato, prope basin valde constricto, angulis posticis rectis, subproductis, 

foveis utrinque profundis duabus, altera majore prope angulum, altera minore sublineari prope lineam 
dorsalem ; elytris oblongo-ovatis, humeris sat late rotundatis, dorso prope suturam depresso, stria suturali

Long. 3 lin. (6| millim.). 

Hab. Mexico, Oaxaca (Hoge). 

s • 
Belongs to the same group as T. mexicanus, but differs conspicuously by the greatly 
narrowed base of the thorax and the obliteration of the elytral striae, there remaining 

scarcely any traces except of the sutural one (towards the apex) and the eighth, the 
ninth being indistinct, though indicated towards the apex, near which the interstice is 

interrupted, forming one or more oblong tubercles, more distinct than in T. mexicanus.
