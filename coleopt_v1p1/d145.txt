ANILLUS.—PEEICOMPSUS. 145 

i • 
ANILLUS. 

Anillus, Jacquelin Duval, Ann. Soc. Ent. Fr. 1851, Bull. p. 72. 

- A genus of minute blind beetles, allied to Taehys, hitherto found only in the Medi- 

terranean region and in North America. Ten species have been described. The 
following differs from the typical forms, and also from the allied genera Scotodijpnus 
and Illaphanus in its convex surface, and in the elytra being rounded, not subtruncated 

at the apex. By the absence of striae or distinct rows of punctures, and by the scarcely 

perceptible terminal joint of the palpi, it agrees better with Scotodijpnus than with 

Anillus ; but in the former of these two genera the elytra are much abbreviated, which 

is not at all the case with our species. 

1. Anillus integripennis. (Tab. VI. fig. 5.) 
Minutus, oblongus, subconvexus, breviter setosus, flavo-testaceus, subnitidus ; foveis frontalibus elongatis, sat 

profundis, interspatio subangusto convexo ; antennis robustis, moniliformibus, versus apicem subincras- 

satis; thorace quadrato, postice parum angustato, angulis posticis rectis, basi depressa transversim 

sulcata ; elytris oblongis, apice subabrupte declivibus, subtilissime punctulatis, striis nullis, in loco striolae 

recurvae punctis magnis tribus.

PERICOMPSUS. 

Pericompsus, Leconte, Ann. Lye. N. York, v. p. 191 (1852) ; Schaum, Berl. ent. Zeitschr. I860, 

p. 201. 

Eighteen species of this genns have been described, all American, and ranging 

through temperate as well as tropical latitudes, north and south. A closely allied 

undescribed genus occurs in Australia, of which Tachys australis, Schaum, is the type, 

differing from Pericompsus only in the eighth and ninth elytral striae being separated 
and not sunk together in a marginal groove.

A Guatemalan specimen in the Salle collection is referred to this species. All the
