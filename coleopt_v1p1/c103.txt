COLPODES. 103
5. Colpodes robustus.
Colpodes robustus, Chaudoir, Ann. Soc. Ent. Fr. 1878, p. 2961.
Hab. MEXICO (Putzeys1).
This species was not met with either by M. Sallé or Herr Höge.
6. Colpodes lugens.
Feronia lugens, Dejean, Sp. Gén. Col. v. p. 7711.
Colpodes lugens, Chaudoir, Ann. Soc. Ent. Fr. 1878, p. 2972.
Dyscolus anchomenoïdes, id. ibid. 1845, p. 440.
Colpodes anchomenoïdes, id. ibid. 1859, p. 310.
Var. Colpodes brunnipennis, id. ibid. 1859, p. 312; 1878, p. 2973.
Hab. MEXICO1 2 3, near the capital (Flohr).
This species is confounded with the following (C. mœstus) in the Sallé collection; and a similar mistake was made by no less an authority than the late M. Putzeys, to whom I sent a set of Colpodæ to name. There is no real difficulty, however, in distinguishing the two, C. lugens having a much broader head, and resembling a Platysma, whilst C. mœstus has the oval head and general form of Anchomenus § Agonum.
7. Colpodes mœstus.
Feronia mœsta, Dej. Sp. Gén. Col. v. p. 7701.
Feronia funesta, Chaudoir, Bull. Mosc. 1837, vii. p. 312.
Colpodes tristis, Chaudoir, Ann. Soc. Ent. Fr. 1859, p. 314.
Colpodes mœstus, id. ibid. 1878, p. 2973.
Var. Feronia funesta, Chaudoir, Bull. Mosc. 1837, vii. p. 31.
Var. Feronia opaca, id. ibid. p. 32.
Hab. MEXICO1 2 3, Puebla, Toluca, San Antonio de Arriba (Sallé), Cuernavaca (Boucard3), Las Vigas (Höge), Mexico city (Flohr).
8. Colpodes transfuga.
Colpodes transfuga, Chaudoir, Ann. Soc. Ent. Fr. 1878, p. 2971.
Hab. MEXICO1 Parada (Sallé).
A typical specimen, with label in M. de Chaudoir’s handwriting, is in the Sallé collection.
9. Colpodes guatemalensis.
Colpodes guatemalensis, Chaudoir, Ann. Soc. Ent. Fr. 1878, p. 2981.
Hab. GUATEMALA1, Quezaltenango (Champion).
I refer with some hesitation an example taken by Mr. Champion to this species, with the description of which it agrees except in colour, being deep black with a silky gloss, instead of “brun foncé presque noir.”
