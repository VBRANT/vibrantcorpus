This species was excluded from the genus Colpodes by Chaudoir. I find a label, in 

his handwriting, attached to a specimen in the Salle collection inscribed " gen. nov., 
menti dente bifido ;" but the bifid mentum-tooth is not of generic value in the group 

of which Colpodes forms part, Chaudoir himself, in his monograph of 1859, giving a 

greatrange of form of the tooth in his generic diagnosis. The shape of the fourth tarsal 

joint is probably the character which induced him to exclude the species, this joint 

- 
being simply emarginated, even in the anterior legs; but the tarsi agree with the more 

typical species of the genus in being rather densely clothed with setae beneath ; and the 
long legs and general form ofthe insect agree better with Colpodes than withAnchomenus. 
The upper surface of the joints in the posterior tarsi is bisulcate, the sulci subdorsal 
and approximated.

Of b form to C. monachus, and differing very little, except 

r, from that species. The thorax, however, appears shorter, a little more narrowed 

ds the head, and more abruptly sinuated posteriorly, the widest part being near 

the middle and not anterior to it as in C. monachus
