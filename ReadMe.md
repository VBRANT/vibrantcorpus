Brief Notes for ViBRANT Corpus
==============================

Introduction
------------

The corpus is intended to meet the need for gold standard data to assist in the development and evaluation of natural language processing tools for biodiversity literature. A particular feature of this corpus is the presence of clean (re-keyed) and dirty (OCR) versions of the same text. 

Contents
--------

The primary contents are selected texts from four volumes of the Biologia Centrali-Americana. Each folder contains 50 pages from the volume covering the clean and dirty text versions of each, with their supporting annotation file.

Note: this corpus uses the [brat stand off](http://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html) format for annotation.

Additional resources include:

- another volume from the BCA, the index to the volume of illustrations of Birds, though clean and dirty versions are presented in separate folders, and
- a text from Pensoft, automatically annotated on publication, though being a born-digital publication there is no OCR equivalent for this text.  

Availability
------------

The corpus can be downloaded from [ViBRANT's git repository](https://git.scratchpads.eu/v) as an anonymous user with the following command:  
`$ git clone https://git.scratchpads.eu/git/vibrantcorpus.git`
