STERCULIACEÆ. 129
Tribe FREMONTIEÆ.
Limited to this genus and the monotypic Fremontia, which is endemic in California.
6. CHEIROSTEMON.
Cheirostemon, Humb. et Bonpl. Pl. Æquin. i. p. 81, t. 24; Benth. et Hook. Gen. Plant. i. pp. 212, 983.
The genus is limited to the following species, a celebrated tree;—
1. Cheirostemon platanoides, Humboldt et Bonpl. Pl. Æquin. i. p. 82, t. 24; Bot. Mag. t. 5135.
SOUTH MEXICO, near Toluca, 8250 feet (Humboldt & Bonpland), calcareous mountains near the Pacific Ocean, 7000 feet (Galeotti, 4106), Mexico (Tate, Andrieux,513, &c.); GUATEMALA, Volcan de Fuego, 8000 to 10,000 feet, Volcan de Agua (Hartweg,573; Salvin & Godman), ridge above Cubulco and Altos of Guatemala near Los Encuentros, 7000 to 8000 feet (Salvin & Godman). Hb. Kew.
Tribe DOMBEYEÆ.
Dispersed throughout the tropics.
7. MELHANIA.
Melhania, Forsk. Fl. Æg.-Arab. p. 64; Benth. et Hook. Gen. Plant. i. p. 222.
Herbs or shrubs, about sixteen species natives of Subtropical and Tropical Africa, Asia, and Australia, and the one American species.
1. Melhania ovata, Webb, Spicil. Gorgon. in Hook. Niger Flora, p. 111.
Pentapetes ovata, DC. Prodr. i. p. 498.
Brotera ovata, Cav. Ic. v. pp. 19, 433.
SOUTH MEXICO, near Huanujuato (Cavanilles).
Cavanilles first published this Plant (l. c.), stating that it was raised in the Madrid garden from Mexican seeds; probably this was a mistake. Masters (Oliver’s ‘Flora Tropical Africa,’ i. p. 231) refers Cavanilles’s figure to Melhania abyssinica, without any explanation whatever. Bentham and Hooker (l. c.) quote Cavanilles, but make no mention of a Mexican or American species. Certainly a cultivated specimen in Hb. Kew., bearing the name Brotera alba, appears to be identical with undoubted M. abyssinica, which is a native of Scinde, Abyssinia, and the Cape-Verd Islands.
Tribe HERMANNIEÆ.
8. HERMANNIA.
Hermannia, Linn. Gen. Plant. n. 828; Benth. et Hook. Gen. Plant. i. p. 223.
A genus of about eighty herbaceous and shrubby species, whereof three are natives of Texas, four of Tropical Africa and Arabia, and the rest of Extratropical South Africa.
