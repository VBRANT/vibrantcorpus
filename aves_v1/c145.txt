SIURUS. 145
This is one of the commonest of the winter visitants to Mexico and Central America, being found throughout the country at that season from Mazatlan to Chiriqui. It does not, however, appear to reach the southern continent in its southward flight; nor have we even seen specimens from the line of railway in the State of Panama. Near Mazatlan Grayson only met with it between November and April in the densest woods, where it was shy, solitary, and silent10. Further south its habits are much of this character; but in Costa Rica it has been noticed as early as August7. In Cuba, Dr. Gundlach gives the end of August and the beginning of September as the time of its arrival, and states that it remains in the island in great numbers till the following April9. It is a bird of solitary habits, and frequents woods at elevations ranging from nearly the sea-level to 5000 feet, living mostly on or near the ground, where it seeks its food consisting chiefly of insects, seeds, and small shells.
In North America, though generally a bird of the Eastern Province, in high latitudes it spreads across the continent, and has been found in Alaska15. It usually arrives from its winter quarters about the beginning of May, and remains far into September. During this time it breeds. Its nest is a domed structure, placed on the ground in a bank under the shelter of a projecting root or in a thick clump of bushes. It is made externally of wood, mosses, lichens, and dry leaves, with a few stems and broken fragments of plants. The entrance is strongly built of stout twigs; its upper portion is a strong framework of fine twigs, roots, stems, mosses, dry plants, &c; and the lining is of finer materials of the same kind8. The song of the male during the mating-season is described as being of excellent quality8.
The eggs are stated to vary considerably; the normal colour is creamy white, marked chiefly at the larger end with mingled dots and blotches of red, reddish brown, lilac, dark purple, and ferruginous, these spots in some cases being collected in a crown round the large end of the egg8.
Dr. Coues15 has taken great pains to collect the references to the literature of this species.
