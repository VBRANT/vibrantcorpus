Southern and Central Illinois, Missouri, and in Kentucky; but stragglers are occa- 

sionallymet with as far north as Washington and evenNew Brunswick. Dr. Woodhouse 

also observed it in numbers in Texas, where, however, recent observers do not mention 

its occurrence. Its time of residence in these districts extends from April to October, 
during which it breeds. The rest of the year it spends within the tropics, its line of 
migration nearly coinciding with that of Geothlypis Philadelphia. It is found in 
Northern Yucatan ; but nowhere else in Mexico or Central America until we come to 
Costa Eica, where, and in the State of Panama, a few specimens have been obtained. 
In the Southern continent its range seems confined to the north-western coast, as 
specimens have reached us from the State of Antioquia 8 9
, the neighbourhood of Santa 
Marta, and from near Merida in Venezuela 7 
. In its spring migration it is occasionally 
(but rarely) met with in Cuba in the month of April 12
, but not elsewhere in the 

Antilles. 
The bird is described as being one of the shyest and most silent of all the Warblers. 

Its place of abode is usually in bushy swamps on the margin of stagnant pools. Its 
nest is placed in a hollow snag, a Woodpecker's hole being often chosen for its site 10

HELMINTHOTHERUS.

Two not very closely allied species are usually placed in this genus

â€”

H. vermivorus, 
the bird treated of below, and II swainsoni, a rare species of which little is known, a 
few specimens only having as yet been met with in the South-eastern States and in 
Cuba and Jamaica. For the latter bird a separate generic name%Helinaia was proposed 
by Audubon. Helminthotherus, though differing greatly in coloration, is structurally not 
far removed from Protonotaria, and has a long bill like that bird, and the middle toe 
about equal to the tarsus. The bill, however, is rather stouter, the culmen somewhat 
depressed, and the rictal bristles more fully developed. H. vermivorus is a strictly 
migratory species, spending the winter in Mexico and Central America.
