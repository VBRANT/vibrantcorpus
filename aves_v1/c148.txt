its being not common near Mazatlan, where it frequents stagnant pools or solitary brooks12.
In North America, where it is only known as a summer visitant, its chief resort is the Southern and South-western States, appearing only as a straggler in more northern districts. It is one of the earliest Warblers to arrive, and may be heard in full song from the end of February. Its song is distinguished by the richness and power of its note14. Not much seems to be known of its nest and eggs, as Brewer’s account of them is taken from Audubon14.
As in the case of the two preceding species, its literature is fully given in Dr. Coues’s volume4.
OPORORNIS.
Oporornis, Baird, B. N. Am. p. 246 (1858). (Type Sylvia agilis, Wils.)
The members of this genus much resemble some of the next following, the style of colour being much the same. They have, however, the wing pointed and longer than the tail, in which character they agree with Siurus. The bill has a distinct notch, the rictal bristles very short, the tail nearly even, the feathers acuminate, and the under coverts long. The tarsi are Long. and the claws large.
Two species are known of the genus, whereof one, O. formosa, enters our fauna as a winter visitant. Of the other, O. agilis, the history is by no means complete. It is not known to have occurred beyond the borders of the Eastern States; and though not uncommon at certain seasons in Massachusetts, its breeding-haunts have not yet been detected.
