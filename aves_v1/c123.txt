Parula gutturalis, Baird, Rev. Am. B. i. p. 1722; Lawr. Ann. Lyc. N. Y. ix. p. 933; v. Frantzius, J. f. Orn. 1869, p. 2924; Salv. P. Z. S. 1870, p. 1825.
Supra cinerea, capitis lateribus paulo obscurioribus, dorso medio nigerrimo; subtus gula et pectore aureo-flavis, ventre albido-cinereo, hypochondriis pure ciereis: rostro nigro, pedibus plumbeis. Long. tota 4·8, alæ 2·5, caudæ 1·9, rostri a rictu 0·55, tarsi 0·7. (Descr. maris ex Chiriqui, Panama. Mus. nostr.)
Hab. COSTA RICA, Volcan de Irazu (v. Frantzius1 4, J. Cooper3, Rogers), Rancho Redondo (J. Carmiol); PANAMA, Volcan de Chiriqui (Arcé5).
This pretty species was first discovered in the volcano of Irazu by Dr. von Frantzius, who sent to the Berlin Museum the single specimen which formed the type of Dr. Cabanis’s description. This specimen seems to have been a female bird, or one in immature plumage, as its describer speaks of the back being faintly spotted with black, an indication only of the peculiar conspicuous black crescentic spot which is so marked a feature in the adult bird.
The species does not appear to be at all a common one, its range being restricted to the higher mountains of Costa Rica and the adjoining volcano of Chiriqui. Here it probably seldom descends below an elevation of 6000 feet, the height at which Dr. von Frantzius found it4. It has no near allies, but comes next, perhaps, to P. superciliosa of Mexico and Guatemala.
Our figure is taken from a specimen in our collection from Chiriqui.
DENDRŒCA.
Dendroica, G. R. Gray, List Gen. B. App. p. 8 (1842) (type Motacilla coronata, Linn.); Baird, Brew. & Ridgw. N. Am. B. i. p. 215.
This genus contains more species than any other of the family, some six and twenty being now included in it; of these, twenty-two are recognized inhabitants of the United States, all but six of which pass the winter months within our border. In addition to these we find two, D. vieillotti and D. decora, which probably reside throughout the year, making a total of eighteen belonging to Central America and Mexico at one time of the year or another.
The members of Dendrœca vary much in colour, which, however, serves to group the species into more or less natural sections. Some of the leading characters which are used to define the genus as a whole are:—the more or less depressed bill, which is less acute than in Helmintherus, Helminthophaga, and Parula, and notched near the tip; the rictal bristles are fairly developed; the middle toe is short as compared with the tarsus; the wings much longer than the tail, the first and second primaries being the longest; the tail is nearly even, and always blotched with yellow or white.
