Helminthophaga pinus is by no means a common bird in either Mexico or Central America in winter, the only time of year it is to be found there. Besides being included in Swainson’s list of Bullock’s birds, the evidence of its occurrence in Mexico is almost confined to the appearance of its name in the first list of Mons. Sallé’s birds9, to the existence of one of Deppe’s specimens in the Berlin Museum, and to the mention of a Mexican specimen in the Smithsonian Institution3; the bird seems to have been unnoticed by de Oca, Sumichrast, and other assiduous collectors in Mexico. In Guatemala it occurs most frequently in the neighbourhood of Coban; but, besides being found in this mountain-region, we obtained it almost at the sea-level in the Polochic valley and at Retalhuleu, less than 1000 feet above the Pacific Ocean. Like so many of its family, it is to be found in the neighbourhood of cleared ground.
In the States, though it occurs in Texas6, it is almost exclusively an eastern bird. Here it spends the breeding-season, remaining from the early part of May to September or October4. Its nest is described by Wilson7; but his account of it does not tally with that of Mr. Ridgway, who found several near Mount Carmel in Illinois, where the bird is plentiful. The latter authority says that the nest is a very loose open structure, composed chiefly of broad thin flexible strips of bark.
The synonymy of this bird has been much involved with that of Dendrœca pinus, a very different species. The difficulties connected with this question have been carefully unravelled by Dr. Coues5.
b. Cauda uniformis, macula alba nulla.
