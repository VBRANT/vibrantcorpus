MNIOTILTA.—PROTONOTARIA. 111
recorded from the Windward Islands, which, doubtless, lie to the eastward of its route of migration. In Jamaica it is said that a few remain to breed23; but in Cuba none have been observed to do so25.
The range of Mniotilta varia in North America is extensive; but the bird is said to be nowhere abundant. It does not pass the Rocky Mountains, and reaches the Pacific at no point north of Mazatlan. In the States, except perhaps in Texas, it is essentially a summer visitant, and it breeds throughout the country from Texas (where Heermann found its nest) northwards. Its habits are well described by Brewer23 as resembling those of a Creeper (Certhia) in its constant practice of climbing along the limbs and stems of trees in search of food. In its winter quarters a sharp call is the only note it utters; but in the breeding-season its song is described as sweet and pleasing though not powerful.
The nest is always built upon the ground.

A single, peculiar-looking species constitutes this genus—a bird with a long bill and long wings, and remarkable for the purity of the yellow colour of its head and underparts. The species is a scarce one in Central America, visiting Yucatan, Costa Rica, and Panama during the winter months, and passing the summer in the Southern States.

In its summer quarters the Prothonotary Warbler is restricted to the southern region of the eastern section of the United States, being chiefly found in Kansas,
