CISTOTHORUS. 105
This common North-American Marsh-Wren is widely distributed in the United States, occurring as a summer visitor in New England, and even straggling to Greenland; thence it appears to spread over the whole country to the Colorado basin, and passes southwards to Southern Mexico. It breeds throughout this wide area, and is probably only migratory in the northern parts of its summer range, as it has been observed in winter as far north as the Columbia river on the west and in the Carolinas on the east coast6. In Mexico we know but little of it; but in all probability it is resident there. Guatemala has been included in the range of C. palustris, apparently from an incidental statement in Prof. Baird’s ‘Review of American Birds’4, where that author speaks of Sclater and Salvin’s first article on Guatemala birds as including the mention of a form of C. palustris which was unknown to him. This reference is to C. elegans; yet all recent works on North-American birds include Guatemala, sometimes with doubt, sometimes without, as within the range of C. palustris.
Prof. Baird, in the work just quoted4, separates the western from the eastern bird, distinguishing the former by the name of var. paludicola. But as the species, as Dr. Coues says7, is subject to a good deal of difference in details of coloration which cannot be satisfactorily correlated with any special sex, age, or season, the difference of race does not seem to be capable of definition with certainty. Dr. Coues keeps both together under the single name Cistothorus palustris, which, so far as we can see, is the right way of treating the species. A Mexican specimen in our possession has the scapulars and lower back of a tawny rather than a light brown colour; but this difference may well come within the limits of individual variation.
C. palustris was first brought into general notice by Wilson, who described it as observed by him in Pennsylvania, and figured it in his great work1; but it was noticed by Bartram several years before, and mentioned in his ‘Travels through Carolina &c.,’ under the name of Motacilla palustris7.
The habits of the species, as well as its mode of nidification, are fully described by Brewer5 and Dr. Coues6.
