In Guatemala we never found it much below 6500 feet, in the Volcan de Fuego, 
where its chief resort is the deep ravines of the mountain and the belt of forest up to 
between 10,000 and 11,000 feet. It is also not unfrequently met with in the lower 

part of the tract of pine trees which clothe the upper 3000 feet of the cone. These 
Wrens are usually seen in small flocks of five or six individuals, which move restlessly 
amongst grass and shrubs near the ground. They keep carefully out of sight, uttering 

a rather clear Wren-like call-note.

CISTOTHOEUS. 

Cistothorus, Cabanis, Mus. Hem. i. p. 77 (1850). (Type Troglodytes stellaris, Naum.) 

This little genus is structurally not far removed from Troglodytes, having a similar 

nostril with a covering membrane. Its tail is very rounded, the bill short and rather 

strongly curved. In coloration it is somewhat peculiar, the dorsal feathers in all the 

species, and those of the head also in some, being conspicuously striated longitudinally. 

Its habits, too, are also peculiar, as it seems to be found exclusively in marshy spots, 
frequenting the long rank grass and reeds which usually grow in such places. 
In addition to Cistothorus Dr. Cabanis proposed a second generic name, Telmatodytes, 

for C. palustris ; but the differences between the two are too slight to be admissible. 
The number of species in the genus is not well ascertained, owing to the difficulty of 
determining the limits of some of them. Seven or eight names have been suggested at 
various times, which are perhaps referable to four or five species. Of these, two come 
within our limits, Cistothoruspalustris, a northern birdwhich finds itsway into Southern 
Mexico, and C. elegans of Mexico and Central America. The last named bird has a 

close ally in North America, and does not seem to be separable from a species of wide 
range in the southern continent to which the name C. polyglottus, Vieill., has been 

applied.
