100 TROGLODYTIDÆ.
albicante. Long. tota 4·4, alæ 1·9, caudæ 1·7, rostri a rictu 0·8, tarsi 0·8. (Descr. maris ex ins. Socorro. U.S. Nat. Mus. no. 58259.)
Hab. MEXICO, Socorro Island (Grayson1 2 3).
In the tint of the upper plumage this Wren resembles T. aedon; but the back is rather greyer in colour. Beneath it is nearly white, without dusky markings. T. intermedius is altogether a browner bird both above and below; and from it, and also from T. aedon, T. insularis differs in its long slender curved bill and in the greater distinctness of the superciliary line.
Grayson, the only naturalist who has seen it, describes the Socorro Wren as the commonest bird on the island, where its song is to be heard throughout the day, either amongst the trees or brush-covered rocks that crop out everywhere. Like all the indigenous birds of the island, it was very tame, and would climb about old logs or creep over the trunks of standing trees, and even turn over leaves at his feet in search of food, every now and then stopping to utter from a twig a cheerful song of considerable volume for so small a bird2. He adds that he often saw it feeding on dead land-crabs, crustacea being eaten more or less by all the birds of the island except the Parrots and Pigeons3.
Grayson describes1 the iris of the living bird as brown, the bill brown above, the mandible paler, the feet brown with black nails.

Supra brunneus, alis et cauda fusco-nigro frequenter transfasciatis; subtus pallidior, bypocbondriis vix, crisso distincte nigro transvittatis, rostri maxilla brunnea, mandibula et pedibus corylinis. Long. tota 4·5, alæ 2·1, caudæ 1·75, rostri a rictu 0·75, tarsi 0·7. (Descr. exempl. ex Dueñas, Guatemala. Mus. nostr.)
Hab. MEXICO8 9, Totontepec and Capulalpam (Boucard8), Merida, Yucatan (Schott4, Gaumer); GUATEMALA, Dueñas, Panajachel, Quezaltenango, Coban, &c, and in all villages throughout the country (O. S. & F. D. G.); COSTA RICA, San José and Quebrada Honda (Hoffmann1), San José and Barranca (Carmiol3).
This is the common House-Wren of Guatemala and Costa Rica, being doubtless found in the intermediate country. It also spreads northwards to Yucatan and the Mexican State of Oaxaca, though we have as yet no record of it from Tehuantepec nor yet from Western Mexico. In Eastern Mexico its place seems to be taken by T. aedon;
