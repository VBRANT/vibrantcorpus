Though found in spring in Texas15, this species appears to avoid Mexico in its migration southwards, the only record of its occurrence in that country being Swainson’s reference to it under the name Sylvicola inornata16. In Guatemala it only came under our notice in Vera Paz in the neighbourhood of Coban and Choctum; and here it is not by any means common in winter. It is not until we come to Costa Rica that H. chrysoptera is found in abundance; but there, as well as in the adjoining State of Panama and in the north-western portions of the continent of South America, considerable numbers pass the winter. The furthest southern point reached by it is the neighbourhood of Bogotá, whence we have received several specimens. In Cuba Dr. Gundlach says that it is of accidental occurrence in the vicinity of Havana during its passage northwards in April14.
In the north it is described as nowhere a common species, and as distributed over a comparatively small extent of country, comprising Georgia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Missouri, and Wisconsin, but straying outside these limits12. Little is recorded of its habits beyond the description of its nest and eggs—the former being composed outwardly of dry leaves interwoven with roots, strips of bark, &c., and lined with fine leaves, grasses, and roots. This nest is usually placed in a low bush or on the ground in a tussock of grass12.
Dr. Coues gives full references to the literature of this species13.
