DENDECECA. 129 

Like D. coronata, this species visits Mexico and Central America in winter, but, 
being a western bird, occupies a rather different area during that season. As in similar 

cases the western form hangs more strictly to the Pacific side of Mexico, and does not 
migrate nearly so far south as its eastern congener. Not uncommon in collections from 
Southern Mexico, D. auduboni hardly penetrates beyond that district ; for we only twice 
met with it in Guatemala 
:—once in November in company with D. coronata at San 
Geronimo, 3000 feet above the sea, where both species were feeding on the ground 

together ; the second time in February, when a solitary bird was shot in an open 

glade of the pine-forest which clothes the mountains above Totonicapam, 10,000 feet 
above the sea. Both these birds are in winter dress ; but birds in summer plumage 
occur in Mexico 3
. In the north Andubon's Warbler is well known throughout the 
Rocky Mountains ; and there seems good reason to believe that it breeds in most of the 
higher ranges from Arizona to British Columbia. A nest taken in Vancouver's Island 
by the late Mr. Hepburn is described 9 as built outwardly of coarse strips of bark, long 

leaves of dry grass, and stalks of plants mingled with finer grasses, pieces of cotton 

cloth and other materials, and inwardly of fine grasses, feathers, lichens, mosses, fine 

roots, &c. all felted together and lined with fur and feathers. The eggs are pure white, 

spotted chiefly at the larger end with red markings. 

Dr. Coues's account of this species is very full, both as to synonymy and as to the 

range and habits of the bird 10
