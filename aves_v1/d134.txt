Though the BlackburnianWarbler has been traced to Utah and even to NewMexico 
during its spring migration 18
, it cannot be considered otherwise than an eastern bird 
during its summer residence in the North-American continent. Its northward range 
extends to the British provinces, and even to Greenland. In passing south in its autumn 
migration it takes a rather peculiar line, missing the West Indies entirely, with the 
exception of the Bahama Islands. In Mexico it is onlyknown in the southern provinces, 
and only on the Pacific side of that country in the vicinity of Tehuantepec 9 
. In Guate- 
mala and elsewhere in CentralAmerica it is generally distributed and common throughout 
the winter months ; and it appears to be equally abundant in the north-western portions 
of South America as far as the central provinces of Peru 19 
. In Guatemala its range 
in altitude is considerable, extending from 1000 to 5000 or 6000 feet. In Colombia, 
according Mr. Wyatt, who observed it in the Magdalena valley, it keeps to the oak- 

forests below the Paramo, seldom descending to a lower elevation than 5000 feet 16 
. It 

is frequently represented in Bogota collections. 
Though Dr. Coues speaks of this bird as a well-known and abundant species in the 
United States 18 
, the account of it given by Brewer 16 is chiefly compiled from the 
observations ofAudubon and his contemporaries. He also describes the nest and eggs, 
but admits that their authenticity is not free from doubt, 
Though I), blackburniw can always be readily distinguished from any other of its 
family, the variation of the plumage, due to season, sex, and age, is considerable. Full- 
plumaged males are more often obtained in the winter at the southern end of its ranse 
than in Mexico or Guatemala, where immature or winter-plumage birds prevail.
