The distribution of this species in winter in Central America is peculiar, It has been 
found in the southern provinces of Mexico, Vera Cruz, Oaxaca, and Tehuantepec, and 
immediately to the southward over a wide district of Guatemala, extending across the 
country ; but beyond this we lose all trace of it until we come to the State of Panama, 
where it occurs not unfrequently on the line of the Panama railway. This is its most 
southern limit. In Cuba it is of rare occurrence, appearing sometimes in the month of 
April on its passage northwards 12 
. It also occurs in the Bahamas 2
, but not in any 

other of the West-India Islands. 
In summer it spreads over the Eastern States northwards to Labrador, Hudson's Bay, 
Great Slave Lake, &c, and westwards to the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, breeding in 
the New England States and northwards 13 
. 

Its song is described as clear and sweetly modulated, surpassing in quality those of 
most of the family. It frequents low woods, searching for its food amongst the 
branches and running up and down the trunks of trees in pursuit of insects and their 

larvae. It also catches insects on the wing, and takes them from open flowersn 
. The 

nest is usually placed in a fir tree a few feet from the ground ; it is described as a rather 

loose shallow structure, made almost entirely of slender grasses, fine stems of plants, 

a little moss or spruce-twigs, and lined with fine black roots of herbaceous plants. The 

eggs are cream-colour or ashy white, sparingly spotted with lilac and umbern
.
