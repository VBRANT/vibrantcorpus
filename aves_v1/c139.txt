Hab. NORTH AMERICA, Rocky Mountains to Pacific Ocean from the Columbia river southwards6 7.—MEXICO, Moyoapam (Sumichrast5), La Parada (Boucard8); GUATEMALA, Volcan de Fuego, San Gerónimo, Alotepeque (O. S. & F. D. G.4 9).
So little was known of this species in 1862 and 1863 that specimens that then came into our possession were in one case referred to a different species8 and in another described as new9, errors which were soon afterwards corrected3, and Mexican and Guatemalan examples referred to the bird discovered by Nuttall and Townsend on the banks of the Columbia river in 1835. Since then D. occidentalis has been found in many parts of the Rocky Mountains and in Arizona7. In Mexico its range seems quite confined to the higher districts, Professor Sumichrast having obtained it at an elevation of 8200 feet above the sea. In Guatemala, though it was perhaps most abundant in the belt of pine trees of the Volcan de Fuego which covers the mountain above 10,000 feet, we nevertheless found it at much lower elevations, having shot specimens in the hills surrounding the plain of Salamá about 3500 feet above the sea, and near the mines of Alotepeque at a similar elevation. The bird is always found in the pine-forests; but the trees being of moderate height, specimens were not difficult to obtain. Its habits are similar to those of D. virens; and throughout the day it searches restlessly for food in the outer branches of the trees.
Of its breeding nothing has as yet been recorded. In Guatemala and Mexico it is doubtless only a winter visitant; and in the southern part of its range in North America it has only been observed on passage; but, as Dr. Coues remarks7, it may yet be found to build in the higher pine-belts of the Colorado watershed. The northern part of its range is its summer quarters; and here it no doubt breeds.
