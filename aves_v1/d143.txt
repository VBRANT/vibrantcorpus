Though described as a bird of Texas by Giraud in 1841, it was many years before 

P. olivaceus obtained a satisfactory footing within the limits of the United States. 

Its presence, however, in Arizona was fully established by Mr. W. H. Henshaw in 
1874 ; and the bird now takes its place in the North-American fauna without further 

question. Soon after its first discovery it was found in Mexico and described under the 
name of Sylvicola tceniata by the late Viscount Du Bus 10
, a name shown by Mr. 

Sclater to belong to the same bird as Giraud's Sylvia olivacea 2
. The bird is now well 
known in Mexico, and is included in the lists of nearly every collector who has worked 

in the southern parts of that country. It seems, however, to be strictly confined in its 

range to the high mountains of the interior, where it is a characteristic species between 
5000 and 10,000 feet 8 
. In Guatemala it is also a denizen of the highest districts, 

being common in the upper pine-belts of the volcanos above the elevation of 10,000 

feet. We also met with it in the pine-tracts of Chilasco, in Vera Paz, at about 6000 

feet above the sea. 
Mr. Henshaw describes the habits of this bird as resembling those of Dendrceca 

pinus, the "Pine-Creeper," as it creeps actively over the large limbs of the pine-trees, 

after the manner of that species. In the places where we found the bird the pine 

trees are of no great size, and we did not notice any thing peculiar in the method in 
which it searched for its food. Besides frequenting the pines, we also saw it in the 

scanty bushes found scattered throughout these high districts. 
Nothing is as yet known of its nesting-habits, nor yet of its migrations. Our own 

observations of it extend only to the winter months ; but we are strongly of opinion 

that it remains in its upland home throughout the year.
