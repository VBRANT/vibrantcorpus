and southwards of Costa Rica the Andean race of T. furvus appears. From both of these T. intermedius differs in its rufous-brown colour, though in this respect it approaches the Brazilian form of T. furvus, the tail, however, being shorter and the crissum more strongly banded.
After being for some time doubtfully referred to T. aedon5, or left unnamed9, it was described from Costa-Rica specimens as T. intermedius1 by Dr. Cabanis, and the following year as T. hypaedon by Mr. Sclater7from Mexican and Guatemalan examples. Subsequently Prof. Baird compared Mexican and Costa-Rican birds, and pronouncing them to agree in general appearance, placed both under Dr. Cabanis’s name2.
In Guatemala T. intermedius is a very familiar species, being found in villages and towns throughout the country irrespective of elevation, as we observed it at various places from 8000 feet to the sea-level. Its favourite resort is the thatch or tiled roofs of houses, where it lives a restless life in pursuit of food. Its song is lively, but short, and of no great power or compass. It frequently utters a kind of scolding note, which has doubtless gained for it the name of “Curuchichi,” which not inaptly expresses it. A nest found at Buenaventura, on the Lake of Panajachel, was in a hole in a bank, the eggs being exactly like those of T. aedon, pinkish white, thickly freckled with red spots.
