Of the Bay-breasted Warbler little is known in either Mexico or Central America 

except in the Colombian State of Panama, where it would appear to be not uncommon 

during the winter months. In Mexico the sole record of its occurrence is Professor 

Sumichrast'

s 

7 
; and in Guatemala it is equally rare ; for though we were able to include 

it in the list of the birds of that country 2
, we have never since seen a single specimen 
from there amongst the thousands of bird-skins we have examined. In Costa Rica it 

has not yet been detected at all. In its migration to and from its winter quarters, 
D. castanea, like several of its congeners of the Eastern States, passes the West Indies 
without stopping, barely touches Mexico or Guatemala, but makes straight for the 
Isthmus of Panama and the north-western parts of South America. In the latter 

district it is notuncommon ; and Messrs. Wyatt and Salmon both met with it, the former 

at Naranjo, in the Magdalena valley, and the latter at Eemedios, in the adjoining Cauca 

valley. 
For its summer quarters D. castanea makes for Northern New England, and thence 

spreads to the shores of Hudson's Bay u
, in which district it breeds. Southward of this 

it is known as a bird of passage as far west as the great plains. 
The nest is described by Brewer 
10 as large for the size of the bird, and composed 

outwardly of fine twigs mingled with long hanging mosses ; the lining neatly and 

smoothly made of black fibrous roots, seed-stalks of mosses, and a few hairs. The eggs 
he describes as bluish green, thickly spotted with brown, and generally with a ring of 

confluent blotches of brown and lilac round the larger end.
