Mr. Ridgway, in the ‘History of North-American Birds’6, divided Dendrœca dominica into two races, distinguishable by the colour of the lores, the bird of the Atlantic States and the Greater Antilles having the lores yellow, that of the middle region of North America, Mexico, Yucatan, and Guatemala having the same part white. The difference at most is very slight; and its value is further diminished by the fact of Guatemalan specimens having a slight yellowish tinge on the lores, breaking down the chief point of distinction between Mr. Ridgway’s races.
The limit of the southern migration of D. dominica, so far as is at present known, is Guatemala, where, however, it is a common bird during the winter, and is found at various elevations between 1200 feet and 9000 or 10,000 feet. It does not, so far as we know, stop in the country during the whole year, as has been stated to be the case with the Jamaican bird6. But it arrives early, and abounds near Dueñas from the middle of August till the following spring.
In its summer quarters this species spreads over the whole of the Eastern States as far north as Washington and New York, the race with white lores extending further west to the Mississippi region up to Lake Erie. It doubtless breeds throughout this district; but its nesting-habits seem but imperfectly known, the accounts of Nuttall and Audubon, as given by Brewer6, not agreeing as to its mode of nidification, and more recent information being very scanty on this subject.
The references, however, to the literature of the species are very numerous, occupying a closely-printed page and a half of Dr. Coues’s work8.
