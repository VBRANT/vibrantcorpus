DENDRŒCA. 129
Like D. coronata, this species visits Mexico and Central America in winter, but, being a western bird, occupies a rather different area during that season. As in similar cases the western form hangs more strictly to the Pacific side of Mexico, and does not migrate nearly so far south as its eastern congener. Not uncommon in collections from Southern Mexico, D. auduboni hardly penetrates beyond that district; for we only twice met with it in Guatemala:—once in November in company with D. coronata at San Gerónimo, 3000 feet above the sea, where both species were feeding on the ground together; the second time in February, when a solitary bird was shot in an open glade of the pine-forest which clothes the mountains above Totonicapam, 10,000 feet above the sea. Both these birds are in winter dress; but birds in summer plumage occur in Mexico3. In the north Andubon’s Warbler is well known throughout the Rocky Mountains; and there seems good reason to believe that it breeds in most of the higher ranges from Arizona to British Columbia. A nest taken in Vancouver’s Island by the late Mr. Hepburn is described9 as built outwardly of coarse strips of bark, long leaves of dry grass, and stalks of plants mingled with finer grasses, pieces of cotton cloth and other materials, and inwardly of fine grasses, feathers, lichens, mosses, fine roots, &c. all felted together and lined with fur and feathers. The eggs are pure white, spotted chiefly at the larger end with red markings.
Dr. Coues’s account of this species is very full, both as to synonymy and as to the range and habits of the bird10.
