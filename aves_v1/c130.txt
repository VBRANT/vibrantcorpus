130 MNIOTILTIDÆ.
The distribution of this species in winter in Central America is peculiar. It has been found in the southern provinces of Mexico, Vera Cruz, Oaxaca, and Tehuantepec, and immediately to the southward over a wide district of Guatemala, extending across the country; but beyond this we lose all trace of it until we come to the State of Panama, where it occurs not unfrequently on the line of the Panama railway. This is its most southern limit. In Cuba it is of rare occurrence, appearing sometimes in the month of April on its passage northwards12. It also occurs in the Bahamas2, but not in any other of the West-India Islands.
In summer it spreads over the Eastern States northwards to Labrador, Hudson’s Bay, Great Slave Lake, &c, and westwards to the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, breeding in the New England States and northwards13.
Its song is described as clear and sweetly modulated, surpassing in quality those of most of the family. It frequents low woods, searching for its food amongst the branches and running up and down the trunks of trees in pursuit of insects and their larvæ. It also catches insects on the wing, and takes them from open flowers11. The nest is usually placed in a fir tree a few feet from the ground; it is described as a rather loose shallow structure, made almost entirely of slender grasses, fine stems of plants, a little moss or spruce-twigs, and lined with fine black roots of herbaceous plants. The eggs are cream-colour or ashy white, sparingly spotted with lilac and umber11.
