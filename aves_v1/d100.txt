albicante. Long, tota 4-4, alx 1-9, cauda? 1*7, rostri a rictu 0*8, tarsi 0-8. (Descr. maris ex ins. Socorro. 

U.S. Nat. Mus. no. 58259.) 

ffab. Mexico, Socorro Island (Grayson 1 2 3
). 

In the tint of the upper plumage this Wren resembles T. aedon ; but the back is 

rather greyer in colour. Beneath it is nearly white, without dusky markings. T. inter- 

medins is altogether a browner bird both above and below ; and from it, and also from 

T. aedon, T. insularis differs in its long slender curved bill and in the greater distinct- 

ness of the superciliary line. 

Grayson, the only naturalist who has seen it, describes the Socorro Wren as the 

commonest bird on the island, where its song is to be heard throughout the day, 

either amongst the trees or brush-covered rocks that crop out everywhere. Like all 

the indigenous birds of the island, it was very tame, and would climb about old logs 

or creep over the trunks of standing trees, and even turn over leaves at his feet in 

search of food, every now and then stopping to utter from a twig a cheerful song of 

considerable volume for so small a bird 2 
. He adds that he often saw it feeding on 

dead land-crabs, Crustacea being eaten more or less by all the birds of the island except 

the Parrots and Pigeons 3 
. 
Grayson describes x the iris of the living bird as brown, the bill brown above, the 

mandible paler, the feet brown with black nails.

Supra brunneus, alis et Cauda fusco-nigro frequenter transfasciatis ; subtus pallidior, bypocbondriis vix, crisso 

distincte nigro transyittatis, rostri maxilla brunnea, mandibula et pedibus corylinis. Long, tota 4*5, 

alse 2-1, caudse 1*75, rostri a rictu 0-75, tarsi 0-7. (Descr. exempl. ex Duenas, Guatemala. Mus. nostr.)

This is the common House-Wren of Guatemala and Costa Eica, being doubtless 

found in the intermediate country. It also spreads northwards to Yucatan and the 
Mexican State of Oaxaca, though we have as yet no record of it from Tehuantepec nor 

yet fromWestern Mexico. In EasternMexico its place seems to be taken by T. aedon;
