TROGLODYTES. 103
not far from Riobamba1. Mr. Buckley’s recent collections from the same country also contained examples. From Ecuador it has since been traced southwards to Peru5 and Bolivia4, and northwards to the Colombian State of Antioquia3, and now to Costa Rica. It seems to enjoy a considerable range in altitude, as Fraser’s specimens were obtained a little under 10,000 feet above the sea, Salmon’s in Antioquia at a much lower elevation, and some of Mr. Buckley’s at Puna Island, almost at the sea-level. Salmon found its nest, which he describes as placed in a hole in a wall or bank, or any convenient spot, being made of soft blades of grass with an entrance at the side. The eggs are white, spotted with small red spots, but not nearly so profusely as those of T. aedon.

This is a well-marked Wren belonging to the group containing T. aedon and its allies, being of about the size of that species, and having a tail of similar proportions. In colour, however, it somewhat recalls the North-American T. hyemalis, its longer tail, larger size, and clear fulvous colour of the under surface distinguishing it from that species. We suspect, however, that the first specimens obtained by M. Sallé at El Jacale10, and called T. hyemalis by Mr. Sclater, were really T. brunneicollis. These birds have now been lost sight of and cannot be traced; but as they are the origin of the only reference to T. hyemalis in Mexico, we think that they were very likely misnamed.
The first recognition of this Wren was based upon specimens obtained in December 1857 at La Parada by M. Boucard. This village is in the highlands of Oaxaca, and stands at an elevation of about 10,000 feet above the sea. T. brunneicollis has since been traced to many other parts of Southern Mexico, being, according to Prof. Sumichrast, one of the commonest species of the alpine region of Vera Cruz at an elevation of from 5000 feet to 6500 feet above the sea8.
