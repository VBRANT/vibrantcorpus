Parula americana is the only strictly migratory species of its genus. It passes the breeding-season in the more northern States and Canada, and the winter months in Florida12, Mexico, Guatemala, and the Northern Antilles. In the intervening country it is known as a bird of passage during its spring and autumn migrations. In Mexico it touches the Pacific coast only in the extreme south, being absent from the western coast generally. On the eastern side it appears in the vicinity of Orizaba and in Northern Yucatan, and thence passes southwards to Coban in Guatemala, the only place in that country where we ever met with it. Here it was not uncommon from November onwards through the winter; and specimens used to be brought to us by the Indian boys, shot by their blowpipes in the outskirts of the town. Full-plumaged males, however, are seldom secured; and the same is the case in Cuba—because, as Dr. Gundlach says, they migrate at the period of assuming their breeding-dress. In the Antilles, from Cuba to St. Thomas and St. Croix, P. americana is very abundant in the winter months; but it does not pass southward of these islands, and is quite unknown on the southern continent.
The chief resort of this species is high woods, where it searches for its food amongst the higher branches. Its song, according to some authorities, is barely worthy of the name, as its notes are feeble and few; others describe it as consisting of a varied and pleasing series of notes8. The nest is sometimes fastened to the trunk of a tree, but is more usually suspended from a branch some six or eight feet from the ground and
