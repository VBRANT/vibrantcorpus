TROGLODYTES. 103 

not far from Eiobamba K Mr. Buckley's recent collections from the same country also 
contained examples. From Ecuador it has since been traced southwards to Peru 5 and 
Bolivia 4
, and northwards to the Colombian State of Antioquia 3
, and now to Costa Rica. 

It seems to enjoy a considerable range in altitude, as Fraser's specimens were obtained 
a little under 10,000 feet above the sea, Salmon's in Antioquia at a much lower eleva- 

tion, and some of Mr. Buckley's at Puna Island, almost at the sea-level. Salmon found 

its nest, which he describes as placed in a hole in a wall or bank, or any convenient 

spot, being made of soft blades of grass with an entrance at the side. The eggs are 
white, spotted with small red spots, but not nearly so profusely as those of T. aedon.

This is a well-marked Wren belonging to the group containing T. aedon and its 

allies, being of about the size of that species, and having a tail of similar proportions. 

In colour, however, it somewjkt recalls the North-American T. hyemalis, its longer tail, 

larger size, and clear fulvous colour of the under surface distinguishing it from that 

species. We suspect, however, that the first specimens obtained by M. Salle at 
El Jacale 10
, and called T. hyemalis by Mr. Sclater, were really T. brunneicollis. These 

birds have now been lost sight of and cannot be traced ; but as they are the origin of 

the only reference to T. hyemalis in Mexico, we think that they were very likely mis- 
named. 
The first recognition of this Wren was based upon specimens obtained in December 

1857 at La Parada by M. Boucard. This village is in the highlands of Oaxaca, and 

stands at an elevation of about 10,000 feet above the sea. T. brunneicollis has since 

been traced tomany other parts ofSouthernMexico, being, according to Prof. Sumichrast, 

one of the commonest species of the alpine region of Vera Cruz at an elevation of from 
5000 feet to 6500 feet above the sea 8
