of allied forms all related to D. petechia (Linn.) renders them undesirable as places of 
abode to D. cestiva during the winter months. 
The habits of the species in North America are fully set forth by Brewer 23 
; and the 

vast number of references to its literature and synonymy are elaborated in Dr. Coues's 

recent work 24

This species has been divided into two or three varieties by American authors, the 

• Western-Mexican and Yucatan bird bearing the name " var. bryanti," the Costa-Rica 

and Panama bird " var. rufigula" the original name of vieilloti being restricted to the 

bird of Northern Colombia. The bird is by no means a common one ; and it has taken 

us some years to get together sufficient specimens to enable us to form any opinion as to 

the distinctness or otherwise of the races that have been set up. So far aswe can see, the 

views of Mr. Pidgway and Prof. Baird are borne out in the main ; but some specimens we 

have are so strictly intermediate in the characters compared thatwe are obliged to treat 

our specimens as belonging to one somewhat variable species. According to Mr. Pidgway9 

the strongly pronounced streaks on the flanks of the southern birds is one feature which 

distinguishes them from their northern representatives ; but of five adult birds in our 

possession that which has fewest streaks is from Northern Yucatan ; next comes one 

from the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Pica ; next a bird from the coast of Belize, and lastly 
two birds from Veraguas. As regards the extension of the chestnut colour of the throat, 

the Yucatan bird has the best-defined and most restricted mark ; then come the Nicoya
