Of the Bay-breasted Warbler little is known in either Mexico or Central America except in the Colombian State of Panama, where it would appear to be not uncommon during the winter months. In Mexico the sole record of its occurrence is Professor Sumichrast’s7; and in Guatemala it is equally rare; for though we were able to include it in the list of the birds of that country2, we have never since seen a single specimen from there amongst the thousands of bird-skins we have examined. In Costa Rica it has not yet been detected at all. In its migration to and from its winter quarters, D. castanea, like several of its congeners of the Eastern States, passes the West Indies without stopping, barely touches Mexico or Guatemala, but makes straight for the Isthmus of Panama and the north-western parts of South America. In the latter district it is not uncommon; and Messrs. Wyatt and Salmon both met with it, the former at Naranjo, in the Magdalena valley, and the latter at Remedios, in the adjoining Cauca valley.
For its summer quarters D. castanea makes for Northern New England, and thence spreads to the shores of Hudson’s Bay11, in which district it breeds. Southward of this it is known as a bird of passage as far west as the great plains.
The nest is described by Brewer10 as large for the size of the bird, and composed outwardly of fine twigs mingled with long hanging mosses; the lining neatly and smoothly made of black fibrous roots, seed-stalks of mosses, and a few hairs. The eggs he describes as bluish green, thickly spotted with brown, and generally with a ring of confluent blotches of brown and lilac round the larger end.
