Southern and Central Illinois, Missouri, and in Kentucky; but stragglers are occasionally met with as far north as Washington and even New Brunswick. Dr. Woodhouse also observed it in numbers in Texas, where, however, recent observers do not mention its occurrence. Its time of residence in these districts extends from April to October, during which it breeds. The rest of the year it spends within the tropics, its line of migration nearly coinciding with that of Geothlypis philadelphia. It is found in Northern Yucatan; but nowhere else in Mexico or Central America until we come to Costa Rica, where, and in the State of Panama, a few specimens have been obtained. In the Southern continent its range seems confined to the north-western coast, as specimens have reached us from the State of Antioquia8 9, the neighbourhood of Santa Marta, and from near Merida in Venezuela7. In its spring migration it is occasionally (but rarely) met with in Cuba in the month of April12, but not elsewhere in the Antilles.
The bird is described as being one of the shyest and most silent of all the Warblers. Its place of abode is usually in bushy swamps on the margin of stagnant pools. Its nest is placed in a hollow snag, a Woodpecker’s hole being often chosen for its site10.

Two not very closely allied species are usually placed in this genus—H. vermivorus, the bird treated of below, and H. swainsoni, a rare species of which little is known, a few specimens only having as yet been met with in the South-eastern States and in Cuba and Jamaica. For the latter bird a separate generic name Helinaia was proposed by Audubon. Helminthotherus, though differing greatly in coloration, is structurally not far removed from Protonotaria, and has a long bill like that bird, and the middle toe about equal to the tarsus. The bill, however, is rather stouter, the culmen somewhat depressed, and the rictal bristles more fully developed. H. vermivorus is a strictly migratory species, spending the winter in Mexico and Central America.
