and southwards of Costa Rica the Andean race of T.furvus appears. From both of 
these T. intermedins differs in its rufous-brown colour, though in this respect it 
approaches the Brazilian form of T. furvus, the tail, however, being shorter and the 
crissum more strongly banded. 
After being for some time doubtfully referred to T. aedon 5
, or left unnamed 9
, it was 
described from Costa-Rica specimens as T. intermedins 1 by Dr. Cabanis, and the follow- 
ing year as T. lypaedon by Mr. Sclater 7 from Mexican and Guatemalan examples. 
Subsequently Prof. Baird compared Mexican and Costa-Rican birds, and pronouncing 
them to agree in general appearance, placed both under Dr. Cabanis's name 2
. 
In Guatemala T. intermedins is a very familiar species, being found in villages and 
towns throughout the country irrespective of elevation, as we observed it at various 
places from 8000 feet to the sea-level. Its favourite resort is the thatch or tiled roofs 
of houses, where it lives a restless life in pursuit of food. Its song is lively, but short, 
and ofno great power or compass. It frequently utters a kind of scolding note, which 
has doubtless gained for it the name of " Curuchichi," which not inaptly expresses it. 
A nest found at Buenaventura, on the Lake of Panajachel, was in a hole in a bank, the 
eggs being exactly like those of T. aedon, pinkish white, thickly freckled with red spots.
