The application of Vieillot’s name Turdus moticilla has long been a matter of doubt, and was always so treated by American writers until 1877, when Dr. Coues3 satisfied himself that it was really meant for the bird usually known under Audubon’s title Siurus ludovicianus. In taking this course he followed the opinion of Bonaparte and Cabanis2 on this point.
Siurus motacilla, as it is now the fashion to call this species, has very much the same range in our territory as S. noveboracensis, except that it does not penetrate beyond the district of Chiriqui, and hence falls short of the extended range of its congener in the southern continent. It is nowhere so abundant as that species, though found in places of considerable differences of altitude, ranging from 5000 feet to nearly the sea-level. In Guatemala we usually found it in the forest in the bed of a dry watercourse or the bottom of a ravine, S. noveboracensis seeking rather the more open running streams. Our earliest specimens were obtained in August and September; and it probably stays in the country until the following April. Its habits closely resemble those of its congener; and in the winter season its note is a clear sharp call. Grayson speaks of
