Though the Blackburnian Warbler has been traced to Utah and even to New Mexico during its spring migration18, it cannot be considered otherwise than an eastern bird during its summer residence in the North-American continent. Its northward range extends to the British provinces, and even to Greenland. In passing south in its autumn migration it takes a rather peculiar line, missing the West Indies entirely, with the exception of the Bahama Islands. In Mexico it is only known in the southern provinces, and only on the Pacific side of that country in the vicinity of Tehuantepec9. In Guatemala and elsewhere in Central America it is generally distributed and common throughout the winter months; and it appears to be equally abundant in the north-western portions of South America as far as the central provinces of Peru19. In Guatemala its range in altitude is considerable, extending from 1000 to 5000 or 6000 feet. In Colombia, according Mr. Wyatt, who observed it in the Magdalena valley, it keeps to the oak-forests below the Paramo, seldom descending to a lower elevation than 5000 feet16. It is frequently represented in Bogota collections.
Though Dr. Coues speaks of this bird as a well-known and abundant species in the United States18, the account of it given by Brewer16 is chiefly compiled from the observations of Audubon and his contemporaries. He also describes the nest and eggs, but admits that their authenticity is not free from doubt.
Though D. blackburniæ can always be readily distinguished from any other of its family, the variation of the plumage, due to season, sex, and age, is considerable. Full-plumaged males are more often obtained in the winter at the southern end of its range than in Mexico or Guatemala, where immature or winter-plumage birds prevail.
