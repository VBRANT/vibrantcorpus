Very little is known of Dendrœca pennsylvanica in Mexico; for though both de Oca and Boucard found it in the State of Vera Cruz17 18, Prof. Sumichrast omits to mention it, nor do we find its name included in the lists of the birds of Western Mexico. In Guatemala it is not a common species in the winter months, though we found it dispersed over a wide area; but in Costa Rica and the adjoining State of Panama it is abundant, judging from the number of specimens that have been sent us from there. Here a large proportion of the emigrants from the north must pass the winter; and in seeking these countries from the Eastern States they omit to stop on any of the West-India Islands on their route, with the exception of the Bahamas, where Bryant found this bird16. The line of the Panama railway seems to be the limit of its wanderings, as we have no record of its passing into the southern continent.
In the north its range extends almost exclusively to the Eastern States and Canada13, and it breeds abundantly in New England12. Its nest is described as being constructed of strips of red-cedar bark, well lined with coarse hair, and placed in the fork of a low bush four or five feet from the ground. The eggs are white, blotched and dotted over the entire surface with profuse markings of lavender and dark purple intermixed with lighter spots of reddish brown12.
For full references to the literature of the species Dr. Coues’s work had best be consulted13.
