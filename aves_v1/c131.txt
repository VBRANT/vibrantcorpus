DENDRŒCA. 131
record of its appearance in that country being Lichtenstein’s, on the authority of Deppe’s specimens captured some fifty years ago. In Guatemala we never met with it; and the only notices we have of its occurrence in that country are those given by Prof. Baird in his ‘Review of American Birds’5. Though obtained at San Pedro, in Honduras, by Whitely, this place would appear to be still out of the usual line of its winter migration; for it has hardly been noticed in either Nicaragua or Costa Rica, and it is only in the State of Panama that we find it in any numbers. Here it would appear to be not uncommon. In the southern continent its range is very wide, and skins of it may not unfrequently be seen in collections made as far south as Bolivia. In Cuba its appearance is casual and chiefly confined to the north coast12. The line of migration of D. cærulea seems to pass almost directly from the United States to Panama, a few individuals being tempted to the promontory of Yucatan and to a few points on the east coast of Central America. Striking the southern continent in the State of Panama the migrants disperse, spreading over the countries lying between Colombia and Bolivia.
In the north it has a rather wide range, being most abundant in the Mississippi valley; thence it spreads to the Rocky Mountains, to the Atlantic States, though in small numbers, and northwards to Canada west13.
The species does not appear to be well known to American ornithologists generally; and Brewer11, in compiling his account of the bird, quotes no later authority than Audubon when describing its nesting-habits and its eggs. According to this writer, the nest is placed in the fork of a low tree, and is composed of fibres and stalks with slender roots intermingled, and lined with fine dry fibres of Spanish moss (Tillandsia). The eggs, five in number, are pure white, with a few reddish spots at the larger end. More recently Mr. Allen15 has been enabled to describe the nest and eggs of this species; and his account differs somewhat from Audubon’s, the eggs being creamy white, thickly covered with blotches of reddish brown.
