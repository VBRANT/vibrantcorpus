Though found in spring in Texas 
15

, this species appears to avoidMexico in its migration 

southwards, the only record of its occurrence in that country being Swainson's reference 

to it under the name Sylvicola inornata 
16
. In Guatemala it only came under our notice 

in Vera Paz in the neighbourhood of Coban and Choctum ; and here it is not by any 
means common in winter. It is not until we come to Costa Rica that H. chrysoptera 

is found in abundance ; but there, as well as in the adjoining State of Panama and in 

the north-western portions of the continent of South America, considerable numbers 

pass the winter. The furthest southern point reached by it is the neighbourhood of 
Bogota, whence we have received several specimens. In Cuba Dr. Gundlach says that 

it is of accidental occurrence in the vicinity of Havana during its passage northwards in 
April 14
. 
In the north it is described as nowhere a common species, and as distributed 

over a comparatively small extent of country, comprising Georgia, Massachusetts, 
New Jersey, Missouri, and Wisconsin, but straying outside these limits 12 
. Little is 
recorded of its habits beyond the description of its nest and eggs—the former being 
composed outwardly of dry leaves interwoven with roots, strips of bark, &c, and lined 
with fine leaves, grasses, and roots. This nest is usually placed in a low bush or on 
the ground in a tussock of grass 12
. 
Dr. Coues gives full references to the literature of this species 13
