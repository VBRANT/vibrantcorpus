Mr. Bidgway, in the * History of North-American Birds ' 6
, divided Bendroeca dominica 

into two races, distinguishable by the colour of the lores, the bird of the Atlantic States 
and the Greater Antilles having the lores yellow, that of the middle region of North 
America, Mexico, Yucatan, and Guatemala having the same part white. The difference 

at most is very slight ; and its value is further diminished by the fact of Guatemalan 
specimens having a slight yellowish tinge on the lores, breaking down the chief point 

of distinction between Mr. Bidgway's races. 
The limit of the southern migration of B. dominica, so far as is at present known, is 
Guatemala, where, however, it is a common bird during the winter, and is found at 

various elevations between 1200 feet and 9000 or 10,000 feet. It does not, so far as 
we know, stop in the country during the whole year, as has been stated to be the case 
with the Jamaican bird 6 
. But it arrives early, and abounds near Duenas from the 
middle of August till the following spring. 
In its summer quarters this species spreads over the whole of the Eastern States as 

far north as Washington and New York, the race with white lores extending further 

west to the Mississippi region up to Lake Erie. It doubtless breeds throughout this 

district ; but its nesting-habits seem but imperfectly known, the accounts of Nuttall 
and Audubon, as given by Brewer 6
, not agreeing as to its mode of nidification, and 
more recent information being very scanty on this subject. 
The references, however, to the literature of the species are very numerous, occupying 
a closely-printed page and a half of Dr. Coues's work 8 
.
