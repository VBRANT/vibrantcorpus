Long. tota 4·4, alæ 2·1, caudæ 1·85, rostri a rictu 0·55, tarsi 0·75. (Descr. exempli ex Socorro Island, Smiths. Inst. no. 50798. Mus. nostr.)
Hab. MEXICO, Tres Marias islands1 2 3, Socorro island2 4 (Grayson).
This species was discovered by the late Col. A. J. Grayson; and all references relate to his specimens, no other collector having met with it. The bird is allied to P. pitiayumi and P. inornata: like the former it has two white bands on the wing; but it differs in the more ashy tint of the blue of the upper plumage, and in the abdomen being dull instead of clear yellow*. In both respects it differs from P. inornata, which bird also is distinguished by the almost total absence of the white wing-bars.
The Tres-Marias and Socorro birds are said to belong to the same species, only differing in the latter being a little larger. It is common in both localities, and in the Marias may be seen and heard in every tree busily searching amongst the foliage for insects, and often repeating a delicate little song3. P. insularis has not yet been detected on the mainland; and, strange to say, none of the allied species are found within five or six hundred miles of its home: of these the nearest, P. nigrilora, comes from the valley of the Rio Grande, P. inornata from Guatemala, and P. pitiayumi from Colombia!
The specimen described is not quite adult, and the plumage of the upper and under surfaces probably duller than in the mature bird.
4. Parula nigrilora.
Parula nigrilora, Coues, Bull. U.S. Geol. Surv. iv. p. 111; Coues, B. Col. Vall. i. p. 2072; Sennett, Bull. U.S. Geol. Surv. iv. p. 113, v. p. 3844; Merrill, Pr. U.S. Nat. Mus. i. p. 1235.
“♂ subcærulea, dorso medio virenti-flavo, alis albo bifasciatis, palpebris nigris immaculatis, loris lineaque frontali nigerrimis; subtus flava, jugulo aurantiaco, abdomine infimo, hypocbondriis crissoque albis. Long. tota 4·5, alæ 2·0–2·2, caudæ 1·8–1·9, rostri a naribus ·38–·4, tarsi ·62–·65, dig. med. ·4.” (Coues, l. s. c.2)
Hab. Valley of the Rio Grande, Hidalgo1 2 3, Lomita4 (Sennett), Fort Brown (Merrill5).
Though the claim of this bird to Mexican citizenship has not been established, it can hardly be doubted that it is to be found at least in the north-eastern parts of that country and on the south as well as on the north of the Rio Grande, where alone it has been met with up to the present time. Mr. Sennett, the discoverer of this species at Hidalgo
* In the ‘History of North-American Birds’ (i. p. 207) the abdomen of P. insularis is stated to be wholly white. This does not agree either with Mr. Lawrence’s description or with the typical specimen before us.
