Bahama Islands 16

Very little is known of Dendrcecajpennsylvanica in Mexico ; for though both de Oca 
and Boucard found it in the State of Vera Cruz 17 18 
, Prof. Sumichrast omits to mention 

it, nor do we find its name included in the lists of the birds of Western Mexico. In 
Guatemala it is not a common species in the winter months, though we found it dis- 

persed over a wide area ; but in Costa Rica and the adjoining State of Panama it is 
abundant, judging from the number of specimens that have been sent us from there. 
Here a large proportion of the emigrants from the north must pass the winter ; and in 

seeking these countries from the Eastern States they omit to stop on any of the West-India 

Islands on their route, with the exception of the Bahamas, where Bryant found this 

bird 16
. The line of the Panama railway seems to be the limit of its wanderings, as we 
have no record of its passing into the southern continent. 

In the north its range extends almost exclusively to the Eastern States and Canada 13
, 
and it breeds abundantly in NewEngland 12 
. Its nest is described as being constructed 

of strips of red-cedar bark, well lined with coarse hair, and placed in the fork of a 
low bush four or five feet from the ground. The eggs are white, blotched and dotted 

over the entire surface with profuse markings of lavender and dark purple intermixed 

with lighter spots of reddish brown 12 
. 
For full references to the literature of the species Dr. Coues's work had best be 

consulted 13
