and Belize birds (which hardly differ in this respect), and lastly the two Veraguan 

specimens. 
From this it will be seen that a case for the separate distribution of these birds cannot 
well be made out ; and as they do not occupy distinct areas, the differences pointed out 

are not sufficiently stable to enable their bearers to be known by different names. 
With but few exceptions D. vieilloti has hitherto been found' at no great distance 
from the sea. Our own personal acquaintance with it is limited to two occasions :

— 

one, when we met with it on Half-moon Cay, one of the coral islands off the coast of 

British Honduras ; and the other on the outskirts of the port of Punta Arenas in Costa 

Eica. In habits the bird much resembles D. cestiva, and, indeed, is hardly to be distin- 
guished from it when moving restlessly in search of its food. 
The records of the occurrence of the species inland are by Grayson, who observed it 
near Guadalaxara, in Mexico 7
, and by von Frantzius, who saw it in May near San Jose 

in Costa Eica. 
D. vieilloti is no doubt the continental representative of the Antillean D. petechia, 
which, under certain slight modifications, isfound in so many of the West-Indian islands, 
and even in the Galapagos archipelago ; but from all these forms it is distinguishable 
by its throat being chestnut as well as the head. Its head quarters is undoubtedly 
Central America, as it only just penetrates into the southern continent. An allied 

species is found in Western Ecuador, which is not separable, so far as we can see, from 
the Galapagos bird, J), aureola, or, for that matter, from the Jamaican D. petechia itself.
