In Guatemala Dendrœca virens is one of the commonest species of Mniotiltidæ during the winter months, but is more abundant in Vera Paz and on the eastern side of the country than about Dueñas, where its place is to some extent, though not entirely, taken by D. townsendi. It frequents, like the rest of its family, the second-growth woods, and may always be found during the period of its stay in the outskirts of plantations, its only note during this season being a sharp call. In Mexico it would appear to be equally abundant in winter, as all cellectors seem to have met with it, and Prof. Sumichrast speaks of it as found everywhere in the State of Vera Cruz. On the Pacific side of the country it only appears in the neighbourhood of Tehuantepec. In Costa Rica it is also common in winter, but in the State of Panama perhaps less so, though several specimens have been sent us from the line of railway. In Cuba it is rare, Dr. Gundlach having seen it but few times16. In Jamaica it was unknown until quite recently, when Mr. E. Newton discovered it in the island and sent home several specimens19.
In North America D. virens is essentially a bird of the Eastern Province, extending westwards to the edge of the plains and northwards to the temperate portions of the British possessions. Beyond these limits it has been known to stray to Greenland, and even to Heligoland18! It breeds in the northern portion of its range and in the New-England States. The nest is described by Brewer15 as a small, snug, compact structure built on a base of fine strips of bark, bits of leaves, and stems of plants; the lining consists of fine down and silky stems of plants. The eggs have a white or purplish-white ground, and are blotched and dotted with markings of reddish and purplish brown diffused over the whole surface, but especially at the larger end.
