of allied forms all related to D. petechia (Linn.) renders them undesirable as places of abode to D. æstiva during the winter months.
The habits of the species in North America are fully set forth by Brewer23; and the vast number of references to its literature and synonymy are elaborated in Dr. Coues’s recent work24.

This species has been divided into two or three varieties by American authors, the Western-Mexican and Yucatan bird bearing the name “var. bryanti,” the Costa-Rica and Panama bird “var. rufigula,” the original name of vieilloti being restricted to the bird of Northern Colombia. The bird is by no means a common one; and it has taken us some years to get together sufficient specimens to enable us to form any opinion as to the distinctness or otherwise of the races that have been set up. So far as we can see, the views of Mr. Ridgway and Prof. Baird are borne out in the main; but some specimens we have are so strictly intermediate in the characters compared that we are obliged to treat our specimens as belonging to one somewhat variable species. According to Mr. Ridgway9 the strongly pronounced streaks on the flanks of the southern birds is one feature which distinguishes them from their northern representatives; but of five adult birds in our possession that which has fewest streaks is from Northern Yucatan; next comes one from the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica; next a bird from the coast of Belize, and lastly two birds from Veraguas. As regards the extension of the chestnut colour of the throat, the Yucatan bird has the best-defined and most restricted mark; then come the Nicoya
