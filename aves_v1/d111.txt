MNIOTILTA.—PROTONOTARIA. Ill 

recorded from the Windward Islands, which, doubtless, lie to the eastward of its route of 
migration. In Jamaica it is said that a few remain to breed 23 
; but in Cuba none have 
been observed to do so 25
. 
The range of Mniotilta varia in North America is extensive ; but the bird is said to 
be nowhere abundant. It does not pass the Rocky Mountains, and reaches the Pacific 

at no point north of Mazatlan. In the States, except perhaps in Texas, it is essentially 
a summer visitant, and it breeds throughout the country from Texas (where Heermann 
found its nest) northwards. Its habits are well described by Brewer 23 as resembling 
those of a Creeper (Certhia) in its constant practice of climbing along the limbs and 
stems of trees in search of food. In its winter quarters a sharp call is the only note 

it utters ; but in the breeding-season its song is described as sweet and pleasing though 
not powerful. 
The nest is always built upon the ground. 

PROTONOTARIA. 

Protonotaria, Baird, B. N. Am. p. 239 (1858). (Type Motacilla citrea, Bodd.) 

Protonotaria, Baird, Brew. & Ridgw. N. Am. B. i. p. 183. 
A single, peculiar-looking species constitutes this genus—a bird with a long bill and 
long wings, and remarkable for the purity of the yellow colour of its head and under- 
pays. The species is a scarce one in Central America, visiting Yucatan, Costa Rica, 
and Panama during the winter months, and passing the summer in the Southern 

States.
