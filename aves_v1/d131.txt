record of its appearance in that countrybeing Lichtenstein's, on the authority of Deppe's 
specimens captured some fifty years ago. In Guatemala we never met with it ; and 
the only notices we have of its occurrence in that country are those given by Prof. Baird 
in his 'Review of American Birds 
'5 
. Though obtained at San Pedro, in Honduras, by 
Whitely, this place would appear to be still out of the usual line of its winter migration 

; 

for it has hardly been noticed in either Nicaragua or Costa Eica, and it is only in the 
State of Panama that we find it in any numbers. Here it would appear to be not 
uncommon. In the southern continent its range is very wide, and skins of it may not 
unfrequently be seen in collectionsmade as far south as Bolivia. InCuba its appearance 

is casual and chiefly confined to the north coast 12 
. The line of migration of I), ccerulea 
seems to pass almost directly from the United States to Panama, a few individuals being 
tempted to the promontory of Yucatan and to a few points on the east coast of 
Central America. Striking the southern continent in the State of Panama the migrants 

disperse, spreading over the countries lying between Colombia and Bolivia. 
In the north it has a rather wide range, being most abundant in the Mississippi 

valley ; thence it spreads to the Rocky Mountains, to the Atlantic States, though in small 
numbers, and northwards to Canada west 13 
. 
The species does not appear to be well known to American ornithologists generally 

; 

and Brewer 11
, in compiling his account of the bird, quotes no later authority than 
Audubon when describing its nesting-habits and its eggs. According to this writer, the 
nest is placed in the fork of a low tree, and is composed of fibres and stalks with slender 
roots intermingled, and lined with fine dry fibres of Spanish moss (Tillandsia). The 

eggs, five in number, are pure white, with a few reddish spots at the larger end. More 
recently Mr. Allen 15 has been enabled to describe the nest and eggs of this species; 
and his account differs somewhat from Audubon's, the eggs being creamy white, thickly 
covered with blotches of reddish brown.
